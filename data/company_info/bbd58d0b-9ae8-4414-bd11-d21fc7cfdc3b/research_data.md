Apple grabbed the world's attention with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh. The company unveiled the new machine at an event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, not long after airing a Super Bowl ad directed by Ridley Scott. The Mac wasn't the first computer with a "graphical user interface" that relied on icons rather than command lines. That honor belonged to the Xerox Star. Even so, the Mac influenced the personal computing industry and prompted more intuitive software. [...] Steve Jobs showed off Apple's first iPhone during a keynote presentation at the 2007 Macworld Expo in San Francisco. He said Apple would "reinvent the phone." He was right. The device went on sale in the US on June 29. Since then, Apple has sold more than 2 billion iPhones, making it one of the largest phone makers in the world. The day the iPhone was announced, the company also changed its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc.

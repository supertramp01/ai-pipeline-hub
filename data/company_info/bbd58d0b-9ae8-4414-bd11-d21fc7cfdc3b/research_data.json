Inc.** is an American [multinational corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation \"Multinational corporation\") and [technology company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company \"Technology company\") headquartered in [Cupertino, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California \"Cupertino, California\"), in [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley \"Silicon Valley\"). It is best known for its [consumer electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics \"Consumer electronics\"), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software \"Computer software\"), and [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_service \"Online service\"). Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs \"Steve Jobs\"), [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak \"Steve Wozniak\") and [Ronald Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne \"Ronald Wayne\"), the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the [largest technology company by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_technology_company_by_revenue \"Largest technology company by revenue\"), with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 [fiscal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year \"Fiscal year\").\n\nThe company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's [Apple I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I \"Apple I\") personal computer. Its second computer, the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_(original) \"Apple II (original)\"), became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced [microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\"). Apple introduced the [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\") in 1983 and the [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K \"Macintosh 128K\") in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface \"Graphical user interface\") and a [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse \"Computer mouse\"). By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT \"NeXT\"), and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; [John Sculley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley \"John Sculley\") served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable [market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share \"Market share\") in the [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\") industry to the lower-priced [Wintel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel \"Wintel\") duopoly of the [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\")[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") on [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel \"Intel\")-powered [PC clones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible \"IBM PC compatible\"). In 1997, Apple was weeks away from [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy \"Bankruptcy\").

Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the [Apple Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\"). Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh \"Macintosh\") division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-TheVerge-33) Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-rice19850415-34)\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language \"Programming language\").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-IsProgramingObsolete-35) Its debut was signified by \"[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement) \"1984 (advertisement)\")\", a US$1.5 million television advertisement directed by [Ridley Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott \"Ridley Scott\") that aired during the third quarter of [Super Bowl XVIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XVIII \"Super Bowl XVIII\") on January 22, 1984.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-36) This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-37) and was called a \"masterpiece\" by [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN \"CNN\")[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-38) and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by _[TV Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV\\_Guide \"TV Guide\")_.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-39)\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K \"Macintosh 128K\"), and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $3,000 in 2024). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,600 in 2024), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-40): 195  In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO [John Sculley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley \"John Sculley\"), who had been hired away from [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo \"PepsiCo\") two years earlier by Jobs[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-41) saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-42) Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-43)\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products.

Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [profit margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin \"Profit margin\"), and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [power users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user \"Power user\") snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% [profit margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin \"Profit margin\") of the [Macintosh II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_II \"Macintosh II\").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-insidestoryCarlton-52): 79–80\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on [IBM PC compatibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible \"IBM PC compatible\") with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products. The [Christmas season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_Christmas \"Economics of Christmas\") of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-insidestoryCarlton-52): 117–129  During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing [Michael Spindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spindler \"Michael Spindler\") as the [chief operating officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer \"Chief operating officer\").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004184%E2%80%93185-53) Gassée left the company later that year to set up a rival, [Be Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Inc. \"Be Inc.\")[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004160-54)\n\n### 1990–1997: Decline and restructuring\n\n[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Apple_macintosh_lcII.jpg/250px-Apple_macintosh_lcII.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_macintosh_lcII.jpg)\n\nMacintosh [LC II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_II \"LC II\")\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and, in October 1990, introduced three lower-cost models: the [Macintosh Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic \"Macintosh Classic\"), the [Macintosh LC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC \"Macintosh LC\"), and the [Macintosh IIsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_IIsi \"Macintosh IIsi\"), all of which generated significant sales due to pent-up demand.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004128-55) In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful [PowerBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_100_series \"PowerBook 100 series\") with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [System 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7 \"System 7\"), a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and the PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-lemsculley-56) For some time, Apple was doing very well, introducing fresh new products at increasing profits. The magazine _[MacAddict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacAddict \"MacAddict\")_ named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-57)\n\n[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Apple_PenLite_prototype%2C_1992.jpg/250px-Apple_PenLite_prototype%2C_1992.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_PenLite_prototype,_1992.jpg)\n\nThe [PenLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenLite \"PenLite\") is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform) \"Newton (platform)\").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-58)\n\nThe success of lower-cost consumer Macs, especially the LC, cannibalized higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, for different markets: the high-end [Quadra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Quadra \"Macintosh Quadra\") series, the mid-range [Centris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Centris \"Macintosh Centris\") series, and the consumer-marketed [Performa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performa \"Performa\") series. This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-vawperforma-59)\n\nIn 1993, the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II \"Apple II\") series was discontinued. It was expensive to produce, and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-60) The [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe \"Apple IIe\") was discontinued in 1993.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-61)\n\nApple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including [QuickTake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTake \"QuickTake\")[digital cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera \"Digital camera\"), [PowerCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerCD \"PowerCD\") portable CD audio players, [speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleDesign_Powered_Speakers \"AppleDesign Powered Speakers\"), the [Pippin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin \"Apple Pippin\") video game console, the [eWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWorld \"EWorld\") online service, and [Apple Interactive Television Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Interactive_Television_Box \"Apple Interactive Television Box\"). Enormous resources were invested in the problematic [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform) \"Newton (platform)\") tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-62)\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows \"Windows\") by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-63) Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\") in _[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple\\_Computer,\\_Inc.\\_v.\\_Microsoft\\_Corp. \"Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.\")_[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-lemms-64) The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed. The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by [Michael Spindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spindler \"Michael Spindler\").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-65)\n\n[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/PowerMac_6100-66b.JPG/250px-PowerMac_6100-66b.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PowerMac_6100-66b.JPG)\n\nThe [Power Macintosh 6100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6100 \"Power Macintosh 6100\"), introduced in 1994, was Apple's first new home computer model after the switch to [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC \"PowerPC\") processors.\n\nUnder Spindler, Apple, [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), and [Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola \"Motorola\") formed the [AIM alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_alliance \"AIM alliance\") in 1994 to create a new computing platform (the [PowerPC Reference Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_Reference_Platform \"PowerPC Reference Platform\") or PReP), with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the [Power Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh \"Power Macintosh\"), the first of many computers with Motorola's [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC \"PowerPC\") processor.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-66)\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build [Macintosh clones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_clone \"Macintosh clone\"). Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidmXnw5tM8QRwCpgPA254_254%E2%80%93256]-67)\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced as CEO by [Gil Amelio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Amelio \"Gil Amelio\"), who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator. Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-68)\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system ([System 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_1 \"System 1\")) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this by introducing [cooperative multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking \"Cooperative multitasking\") in System 5, but still decided it needed a more modern approach.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-69) This led to the [Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent \"Taligent\") project in 1988, [A/UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/UX \"A/UX\") that same year, [Copland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system) \"Copland (operating system)\") in 1994, and evaluated the purchase of [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS \"BeOS\") in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive [Jean-Louis Gassée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e \"Jean-Louis Gassée\"), demanded $300 million in contrast to Apple's $125 million offer.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-70) Only weeks away from [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy \"Bankruptcy\"),[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-71) Apple's board preferred [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP \"NeXTSTEP\") and purchased [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT \"NeXT\") in late 1996 for $400 million, retaining [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs \"Steve Jobs\").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-72)\n\n### 1997–2007: Return to profitability\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-archive-73) and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup, which resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup. Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Entrepreneur20111027-74)\n\nThe next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-75) This was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices in the _[United States v. Microsoft Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\_States\\_v.\\_Microsoft\\_Corp. \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\")_ case.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-76) Around then, Jobs donated Apple's internal library and archives to [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University \"Stanford University\"), to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-77)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-78) He ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, [Power Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Computing \"Power Computing\").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-79) On November 10, 1997, the [Apple Store website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store_(online) \"Apple Store (online)\") launched, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer [Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell \"Dell\")'s success.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-80) The moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company had a $309 million profit.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Entrepreneur20111027-74)\n\n[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/IMac_G3_Bondi_Blue%2C_three-quarters_view.png/250px-IMac_G3_Bondi_Blue%2C_three-quarters_view.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IMac_G3_Bondi_Blue,_three-quarters_view.png)\n\niMac\n\n[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Clamshell_iBook_G3.jpg/120px-Clamshell_iBook_G3.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clamshell_iBook_G3.jpg)\n\niBook\n\n[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Apple_Yosemite.JPG/250px-Apple_Yosemite.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Yosemite.JPG)\n\nPower Macintosh G3\n\n[![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Apple_PowerBook_G3_500_Pismo-2763.jpg/120px-Apple_PowerBook_G3_500_Pismo-2763.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_PowerBook_G3_500_Pismo-2763.jpg)\n\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the [iMac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3 \"IMac G3\"). The iMac was a huge success, with 800,000 units sold in its first five months,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-800kimacs-81) and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the [3+1⁄2-inch diskette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk \"Floppy disk\"), being an early adopter of the [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB \"USB\") connector, and coming pre-installed with Internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Alyson_Raletz-82) via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by [Jonathan Ive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive \"Jonathan Ive\"), who had been hired by Amelio, and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple's product design.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Time-83)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-84)\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the [iBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook \"IBook\") consumer laptop. It culminated Jobs's strategy to produce only four products: refined versions of the [Power Macintosh G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3 \"Power Macintosh G3\") desktop and [PowerBook G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G3 \"PowerBook G3\") laptop for professionals, and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-85)\n\nAround then, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired [Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia \"Macromedia\")'s Key Grip digital video editing software project, which was launched as [Final Cut Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Pro \"Final Cut Pro\") in April 1999.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-86) Key Grip's development also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product [iMovie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMovie \"IMovie\") in October 1999.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Bell-87) Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the [DVD authoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_authoring \"DVD authoring\") software DVDirector, which Apple repackaged as the professional-oriented [DVD Studio Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_Studio_Pro \"DVD Studio Pro\"), and reused its technology to create [iDVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDVD \"IDVD\") for the consumer market.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Bell-87) In 2000, Apple purchased the [SoundJam MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundJam_MP \"SoundJam MP\") audio player software from [Casady & Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casady_%26_Greene \"Casady & Greene\"). Apple renamed the program [iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\"), and simplified the user interface and added CD burning.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-88)\n\nIn 2001, Apple changed course with three announcements. First, on March 24, 2001, Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system, [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X \"Mac OS X\"). This was after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X is based on [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP \"NeXTSTEP\"), [OpenStep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStep \"OpenStep\"), and [BSD Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Unix \"BSD Unix\"), to combine the stability, reliability, and security of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface. Second, in May 2001, the first two [Apple Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store \"Apple Store\") retail locations opened in Virginia and California, offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-89)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-First_stores-90)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-MacRumors_stores-91) At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail, but they became highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-fortune-best-retailer-92)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-storelist-2) Third, on October 23, 2001, the [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod \"IPod\") portable digital audio player debuted. The product was first sold on November 10, 2001, and was extremely successful, with over 100 million units sold within six years.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-93)\n\n[![Image 23](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/ITunes_Store_Songs_Sales.jpg/250px-ITunes_Store_Songs_Sales.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ITunes_Store_Songs_Sales.jpg)\n\nThe iTunes Store was highly successful in shaping the legal [music downloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download \"Music download\") industry; chart shows the number of songs sold from 2003 to 2010.\n\nIn 2003, the [iTunes Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store \"ITunes Store\") was introduced with [music downloads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download \"Music download\") for 99¢ a song and iPod integration. It quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 5 billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-94) Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-95)\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased [Nothing Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Real \"Nothing Real\") for its advanced digital [compositing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing \"Compositing\") application [Shake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_(software) \"Shake (software)\"),[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-96) and [Emagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emagic \"Emagic\") for the music productivity application [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro \"Logic Pro\"). The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company.

By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-printel-99) The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the [Mac Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Pro \"Mac Pro\"), [MacBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook \"MacBook\"), and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-100) Apple also introduced [Boot Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp_(software) \"Boot Camp (software)\") in 2006 to help users install [Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP \"Windows XP\") or [Windows Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista \"Windows Vista\") on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-101)\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its [stock price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_price \"Stock price\").

The feature, called \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\"), whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as [targeted advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising \"Targeted advertising\"). After Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in early 2021. A study by [Verizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon \"Verizon\") subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-233)\n\nPrior to the release of [iOS 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_15 \"IOS 15\"), Apple announced new efforts at combating [child sexual abuse material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material \"Child sexual abuse material\") on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor [iMessage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMessage \"IMessage\") users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function \"Hash function\") would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates. However, privacy advocates, including the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation \"Electronic Frontier Foundation\"), condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-234)\n\nIreland's [Data Protection Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Commission \"Data Protection Commission\") launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDPR \"GDPR\") law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-235)\n\nIn December 2019, security researcher [Brian Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Krebs \"Brian Krebs\") discovered that the [iPhone 11 Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11_Pro \"IPhone 11 Pro\") would still show the arrow indicator –signifying location services are being used– at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled, despite all individual location services being disabled. Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment, he was told by Apple that \"It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled. The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings.\"[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-236) Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with [ultra-wideband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-wideband \"Ultra-wideband\") regulations in specific countries, a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone 11 Pro, and emphasized that \"the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data.\" Will Strafach, an executive at security firm [Guardian Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Firewall \"Guardian Firewall\"), confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server. Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device's location.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-237)[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-238)\n\nAccording to published reports by [Bloomberg News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News \"Bloomberg News\") on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_addresses \"IP addresses\") to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents.

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [Fortune 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500 \"Fortune 500\") company. By the time of the \"[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement) \"1984 (advertisement)\")\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-260) According to a 2011 report in _[Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune\\_(magazine) \"Fortune (magazine)\")_, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Fortune1-261) In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching _[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\\_Trek \"Star Trek\")_ and attending [_Star Trek_ conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_convention \"Star Trek convention\") in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-262)\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, some media have suggested that it has lost some of its original character.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-263)[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-264)[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-265)[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-266) Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned.[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-267) Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-cultofmacwork-268)\n\nThe Apple [Fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow#Industry_and_corporate_fellows \"Fellow\") program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [personal computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computing \"Personal computing\").

For instance, [Ron Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Johnson_(businessman) \"Ron Johnson (businessman)\")—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Lashinsky2011-276) Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Fortune1-261)[[273]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-277) Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-278)\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 [SEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\") filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-279) In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-280)\n\nApple has a strong culture of [corporate secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_secrecy \"Corporate secrecy\"), and has an anti-[leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak \"News leak\") Global Security team that recruits from the [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency \"National Security Agency\"), the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\"), and the [United States Secret Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service \"United States Secret Service\").[[277]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-281) In December 2017, [Glassdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassdoor \"Glassdoor\") said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-282) In 2023, _Bloomberg_'s[Mark Gurman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gurman_(journalist) \"Mark Gurman (journalist)\") revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch.

The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[[374]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-378) Greenpeace praised Apple's [sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_metrics_and_indices \"Sustainability metrics and indices\"), noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[[375]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-379) In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing [halogen-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_smoke_zero_halogen \"Low smoke zero halogen\")[USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB \"USB\") and power cables.[[376]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-380)\n\n### Green bonds\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5 billion [green bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_bond \"Green bond\") (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[[370]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Apple-environment-reports-374)[[377]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-381)\n\nSupply chain\n------------\n\nMain article: [Apple supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_supply_chain \"Apple supply chain\")\n\nApple products were made in the United States in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [outsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing \"Outsourcing\") initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by _The New York Times_, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that '[Made in the U.S.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_the_USA \"Made in the USA\")' is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[[378]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-382)\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[[379]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-supply-383)[[380]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-384)\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[[381]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-385) and subsequently invested $200 million in [Corning Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corning_Inc. \"Corning Inc.\"), a manufacturer of toughened [Gorilla Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass \"Gorilla Glass\") technology used in Apple's [iPhones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\").[[382]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-386) The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, [Jeff Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Williams_(Apple) \"Jeff Williams (Apple)\"), told _[CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC \"CNBC\")_ that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology — and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that — that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[[383]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-387)\n\nDuring the Mac's early history, Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[[384]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-388) This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [PCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect \"Peripheral Component Interconnect\") bus in the [7500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7500 \"Power Macintosh 7500\")/[8500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8500 \"Power Macintosh 8500\")/[9500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_9500 \"Power Macintosh 9500\")[Power Macs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh \"Power Macintosh\").

[FireWire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireWire \"FireWire\") is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [IEEE 1394](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394 \"IEEE 1394\") and is a legally mandated port in all cable TV boxes in the United States.[[385]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-389)\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO [Tim Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook \"Tim Cook\") said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[[386]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-390) India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[[387]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-391) In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore \"Bangalore\") and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[[388]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-392) In March, _[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Wall\\_Street\\_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\")_ reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[[389]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-393) and in May, the _Journal_ wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of the [iPhone SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(1st_generation) \"IPhone SE (1st generation)\") in the country,[[390]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-394) while Apple told _[CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC \"CNBC\")_ that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[[391]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-395) In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of the iPhone 7 at its [Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengaluru \"Bengaluru\") facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[[392]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-396) At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[[393]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-397) The opening of the Apple Store was postponed, and finally took place in April 2023,[[394]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-398) while the online store was launched in September 2020.[[395]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-399)\n\n### Worker organizations\n\nMain article: [Apple and unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_and_unions \"Apple and unions\")\n\nApple directly employs 147,000 workers including 25,000 corporate employees in [Apple Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park \"Apple Park\") and across Silicon Valley.[[396]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Downey2021-400)[[397]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Leswing2021-401) The vast majority of its employees work at the over 500 retail [Apple Stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store \"Apple Store\") globally.[[398]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-402) Apple relies on a larger, outsourced workforce for manufacturing, particularly in China where Apple directly employs 10,000 workers across its retail and corporate divisions.

Wozniak had a lifelong dream of building his own personal computer.\n\nWozniak was inspired by the Altair 8800, the first commercially successful microcomputer launched in 1975. Further encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a hobbyist group, he quickly developed a simple gaming motherboard: his first personal computer.\n\n![Image 9: Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs holding an Apple I circuit board in 1976](https://cdn.britannica.com/02/24402-050-2C2345B1/Steven-Jobs-Apple-I-Stephen-Wozniak-circuit-1976.jpg?w=690)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\n In order to create their new company, both Wozniak and Jobs sold some of their possessions. For Wozniak, it was his HP programming calculator.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\n![Image 10: first Apple computer](https://cdn.britannica.com/03/24403-050-33ACE2DB/Apple-Computer-circuit-board-1976.jpg?w=690)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe first Apple computer.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\n![Image 11: The Apple II computer combined modern aesthetics with functionality](https://cdn.britannica.com/04/24404-050-0E38AF29/Apple-II.jpg?w=690)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe Apple II's motherboard had eight expansion slots, providing users with more flexibility when deciding what to add to the computer.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\nWozniak, then a 26-year-old engineering intern at [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.britannica.com/money/Hewlett-Packard-Company), presented his design to his employer. When the company expressed no interest, Wozniak teamed up with a former [high school](https://www.britannica.com/topic/high-school) classmate, 21-year-old Steve Jobs. The two decided to set up their operations in the Jobs family garage, founding Apple Inc. on April 1, 1976, along with Ronald Wayne, an experienced tech industry executive who would play a role in helping facilitate and integrate the young founders’ company vision and operational pursuits.\n\nJobs and Wozniak each held a 45% stake in the company; Wayne had a 10% partnership stake. To fund their venture with working capital, Jobs sold his Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak his programmable calculator.\n\nWith the help of its first [angel investor](https://www.britannica.com/money/venture-capitalist-angel-investing) and Intel Corporation veteran Armas Clifford “Mike” Markkula, the company unveiled its inaugural product, the Apple I, in July 1976 at a Homebrew Computer Club meeting. Selling for $666.66, the Apple I was a bare motherboard with a basic [CPU](https://www.britannica.com/technology/central-processing-unit), random access memory (RAM), and video capabilities, but no keyboard or monitor. Nevertheless, the company’s first product marked the garage start-up’s first success—however minor—selling 200 units that year. Later that year, Ronald Wayne decided to leave the fledgling company, selling back his 10% share for $800.\n\n1977–1978: Apple II and early commercial success\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn January 1977, with Markkula providing his expertise and seed funding of $250,000, Apple Inc. was [incorporated](https://www.britannica.com/money/types-of-business-structures).\n\n[Apple II](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Apple-II), the company’s next product, was released in April 1977 and became the first widely distributed microcomputer. It was a commercial success; some 5 or 6 million units were sold over the next decade.\n\nThis new iteration hinted at a slight design breakthrough with its custom-molded plastic casing, a departure from the steel-encased designs of the time. The Apple II also included color graphics, sound, and television plug-in capabilities. Selling for a base price of $1,298, it was perceived as a user-friendly product, contributing to its success among general consumers.\n\nHaving achieved its first milestone in the larger consumer market, the company boosted its competitive position when Wozniak introduced a disk controller enabling an affordable [floppy disk](https://www.britannica.com/technology/floppy-disk) drive. This inclusion enhanced Apple II’s data storage and retrieval, making it faster and more reliable.\n\n1979: Innovations—GUI, mice, and icons\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn 1979, Jobs led a team of engineers to see the innovations created at the [Xerox Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/Xerox-Corporation)’s [Palo Alto Research Center](https://www.britannica.com/topic/PARC-company) (PARC) in California.\n\n![Image 12: Apple's Lisa computer](https://cdn.britannica.com/05/24405-050-217BD4E9/Apple-Lisa-computer.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nApple's Lisa computer, introduced in 1983, featured a graphical user interface.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\nAt PARC, they were shown three features that would serve as the company’s game-changing innovations:\n\n*   The functional [graphical user interface](https://www.britannica.com/technology/graphical-user-interface) (GUI), featuring on-screen windows\n*   A pointing device known as a mouse\n*   The use of icons (pictographs) in place of awkward command line instructions\n\nThese features would be integrated into two key projects in development: the Apple Lisa (released in 1983) and the Apple Macintosh (1984). (Xerox would later sue Apple in 1989, claiming it stole the idea for its graphical user interface. The lawsuit was dismissed in 1990 on technical grounds, with the court saying Xerox chose the wrong venue to argue most of its legal points.)\n\nThe idea was to develop low-cost and user-friendly personal computers that would introduce the two innovative features—the GUI and mouse—to mass consumers. Although both computers sported these new features, they were designed to appeal to different audiences. The Lisa was geared toward business professionals, while the Macintosh targeted the broader consumer market.\n\n1980–1985: Competition from IBM, Macintosh, and Steve Jobs’ exit\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApple’s profits and size grew at a historic rate. By 1980 the company netted over $100 million and had more than 1,000 employees. In December 1980, Apple went public, offering 4.6 million shares at $22 each.\n\nApple’s [initial public offering](https://www.britannica.com/money/ipo-initial-public-offering) (IPO) was the biggest since 1956 when [Ford Motor Company](https://www.britannica.com/money/Ford-Motor-Company) went public. Further, by the end of 1980, Apple’s nearly $2 billion valuation was greater than Ford’s.\n\n**IBM enters the PC market.** As a formidable contender in the emerging PC market, Apple would soon face competition from [IBM](https://www.britannica.com/money/International-Business-Machines-Corporation), the computer industry’s leading player.\n\nIBM launched its own version of the personal computer in 1981, breaking with its tradition of using only proprietary hardware components and software. Instead, IBM built its PC using readily available components, including an [Intel](https://www.britannica.com/money/Intel) microprocessor and a [disk operating system](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MS-DOS) (DOS) from [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/Microsoft-Corporation).\n\nBecause other manufacturers could use the same hardware components that IBM used and license DOS from Microsoft, new software developers could count on a wide [IBM PC](https://www.britannica.com/technology/IBM-PC)–compatible market for their software. The system soon had a new [spreadsheet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/spreadsheet) program, Lotus 1-2-3, that changed computing and created what would later be known as a “killer app”: a software program (application) so useful that it propels hardware sales.\n\nIBM’s PC won instant support and popularity in the business community, and the Apple II was unable to dislodge IBM’s position. Flanked by its existing suite of business computing products, IBM’s new offering struck a fatal blow to the yet-to-be-released Apple Lisa.\n\nUpon its debut in 1983, the Lisa’s $9,995 price tag was more than five times the cost of an IBM PC. If cost alone didn’t guarantee its commercial underperformance compared to IBM, the Lisa also had numerous hardware issues and incompatibilities that made its performance sluggish compared to its competition.\n\nThe Lisa was an epic failure for the company’s foray into the business computing market. But Apple fared better in the general consumer market with the release the following year of a product that might even be considered iconic, culturally perhaps more so than functionally.\n\n**Apple launches the Macintosh.** Following its failed Lisa launch, Apple prepared for a second product release, hoping to gain a stronger, if not dominant, position in the market. The new product was the [Macintosh](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Macintosh) computer.\n\nAlthough Jef Raskin led the Macintosh research project as early as 1979, Steve Jobs took over the project in 1981, having been removed from the Lisa project due to collaborative tensions. Jobs’ intervention and contentious disagreements with Raskin on the project’s vision and direction prompted Raskin to leave the company in 1982.\n\nIntroduced to the world via television commercial during [Super Bowl](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Super-Bowl) XVIII on January 22, 1984, Apple immediately became a household name. The commercial, directed by [Ridley Scott](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ridley-Scott), struck a hard, albeit symbolic, blow against IBM, associating it with the dystopian and villainous authority of [George Orwell’s](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Orwell) novel _1984_.\n\nIn contrast, the ad portrayed Apple as the countercultural hero of the story—a symbol of freedom, progress, and innovation.\n\nThe Macintosh’s integration of a user-friendly GUI, all-in-one design, and affordable price of $2,500 made it accessible and appealing to businesses and technical users but also, and perhaps more importantly, to general consumers. Although the ad profoundly affected viewers, becoming one of the most iconic commercials in Super Bowl history, it generated more cultural buzz than commercial sales.\n\n1985–1997: Leadership struggles after Jobs and Wozniak\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite ecstatic media reaction, the Macintosh initially sold below Apple’s expectations. The Mac, as it came to be known, had insufficient memory and storage capacity. It lacked essential features like cursor keys and a color display, both of which were considered standard amenities for PCs at the time.\n\nFurthermore, skeptics doubted that adults would ever want to use a machine that relied on the GUI, condemning it as “toylike” and wasteful of computational resources.\n\nIn the wake of the poor sales performance, Jobs was ousted from the company in September 1985 by [chief executive officer](https://www.britannica.com/money/chief-executive-officer) (CEO) [John Sculley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Sculley). (Wozniak had left Apple in February 1985 to become a teacher.)\n\nUpon exiting Apple, Jobs founded another computer company, NeXT Inc., in 1985. The next year, he purchased Lucasfilm’s Computer Graphics Division to create [Pixar Animation Studios](https://www.britannica.com/money/Pixar-Animation-Studios). The founding of both companies, although outside the scope of Apple’s development at the time, would prove instrumental to the company’s forthcoming era of innovation in technology (NeXT’s technology was the foundation of macOS) as well as design and user experience (what is now called UX).\n\nUnder Sculley, Apple made steady improvements to the Mac—most notably, the introduction of an affordable laser printer along with Aldus Corporation’s PageMaker, the Mac’s first killer app (1985). Together, these two innovations launched the [desktop publishing](https://www.britannica.com/topic/desktop-publishing) revolution for consumers and businesses alike. The graphic arts and publishing industries quickly became the Mac’s single most important market.\n\nIn 1987, the Mac II and Mac SE were introduced. The Mac II was the first of the Mac line to incorporate color graphics and a modular design, while the Mac SE was the first of its series to offer an expansion slot (later including a hard drive bay as a standard feature).\n\nAlthough these products boosted Apple’s popularity among consumers, as evidenced by its growing base of one million users, the company would soon be mired in legal challenges that impeded its pace and progress.\n\n**Apple litigates while PCs innovate.** The Mac’s incompatibility with Apple II software, a problem the company initially ignored, slowed educational sales and compelled the company to retain its outmoded Apple II line through 1993, hampering its progress as an industry innovator.\n\nConsumer sales suffered as Apple discouraged game development out of fear that the Mac would not be taken seriously in the business community. Moreover, [Microsoft](https://www.britannica.com/money/Microsoft-Corporation), after an unsuccessful attempt to secure an agreement to market the [Mac OS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/macOS) on the Intel processor, introduced [Windows](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Microsoft-Windows), its own graphical [operating system](https://www.britannica.com/technology/operating-system).\n\nApple litigated for years, in vain, to stop Microsoft from copying the “look and feel” of its operating system, although the Mac OS itself drew upon Xerox’s PARC GUI. Meanwhile, as successive versions of Windows improved and competition among multiple [PC](https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer) manufacturers led to greater innovation and lower prices, fewer consumers were willing to pay the premium Apple had commanded owing to its reputation for quality.\n\nAs the 1980s drew to a close, Apple would find itself facing a few more legal headwinds (including its legal battle with Xerox over the graphical user interface):\n\n*   In 1989, Apple Corps Ltd., the Beatles’ record label, sued Apple for trademark issues related to the company’s name and logo. The legal battle spanned several years; it escalated in the 2000s when Apple introduced [iTunes](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iTunes) and the [iPod](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPod), thereby entering the music industry.\n*   Also in 1989, Apple disposed of unsold Lisa units in a landfill in Logan, Utah. This event became part of tech lore, a symbol of the company’s biggest innovative flop. Meanwhile, Jobs released the NEXTSTEP operating system—a significant development, as it would later serve as the basis for Apple’s Mac OS X upon Jobs’ return to the company.\n\n**Apple-IBM rapprochement.** In a surprising move, Apple and [IBM](https://www.britannica.com/money/International-Business-Machines-Corporation) announced an alliance in 1991. In addition to signing a technology agreement with [Motorola, Inc.](https://www.britannica.com/money/Motorola-Inc) to develop a next-generation chip, known as the PowerPC, Apple and IBM created two new software companies to develop operating system software: Taligent, Inc., and Kaleida Labs, Inc.\n\nTaligent was expected to enable versions of both the Mac OS and the [IBM OS/2](https://www.britannica.com/technology/IBM-OS-2) to run on a new computer hardware standard, the common hardware reference platform (CHRP). Kaleida Labs was to develop multimedia software.\n\nBut as both companies began to quarrel over CHRP engineering specifications and costs mounted to about $400 million for Taligent and $200 million for Kaleida Labs, Apple pulled out with little to show for its investment.\n\n**Apple’s Newton and Claris flops.** Sculley also promised more than Apple could deliver with Newton, a personal digital assistant ([PDA](https://www.britannica.com/technology/PDA)) that suffered from poor handwriting recognition and diverted company engineering and financial resources.\n\nIn addition, the company vacillated over Claris Corporation, its software division, first reorganizing it as an independent company and then reabsorbing it when it began shifting more resources to Windows software.\n\n**Apple continues to flounder.** In 1993, Sculley was replaced by Michael Spindler as CEO. Spindler’s most notable achievements were the successful migration of the Mac OS to the PowerPC microprocessor and the initiation of a shift away from Apple’s proprietary standards.\n\nNevertheless, Apple struggled with marketing projections, accumulating large unsalable inventories of some models while simultaneously unable to meet a billion dollars in orders for other models.\n\nCombined with drastic quality control problems, notably a defective line of monitors and some highly publicized combustible portable computers, these failings brought Spindler’s reign to an end in early 1996 with the appointment of Gilbert F. Amelio.\n\n1997–2010: Renaissance and reinvention\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn 1996, Apple made a pivotal move that would profoundly affect its strategic direction. After several attempts to develop a replacement for its aging Mac operating system, Apple purchased NeXT Software, Inc., the company that Jobs had founded after being ousted from Apple in 1985.\n\nBuilding on this move, Apple, under Amelio’s leadership, began cutting operating costs and reestablishing quality controls. Despite these efforts, only a small percentage of new computer buyers were choosing Macs over Windows machines. Apple’s financial situation was dire toward the end of its second decade.\n\nJobs, now an advisor to Apple’s embattled CEO, quickly became disenchanted with the company’s direction, selling all but one share of the Apple stock he had received in the NeXT sale.\n\nWhen Apple failed to become profitable under Amelio and its worldwide market share fell to roughly 3%, the board of directors in mid-1997 recruited a surprising temporary replacement: Jobs, who for the first time became the undisputed leader of the company he cofounded.\n\n**The return of Jobs: iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.** Upon retaking the helm, Jobs immediately set about revitalizing the company, announcing an alliance with erstwhile foe Microsoft, ending the half-hearted (and profit-draining) program to license the Mac OS, streamlining the company’s multiple (and confusing) product lines, and launching the [iMac](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iMac), the first of many affordable and innovative products to come from the now-revitalized company.\n\n![Image 13: Steve Jobs](https://cdn.britannica.com/64/121664-004-73C27A0C/Steve-Jobs.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\n1998 photo of Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple (Apple Computer), which he co-founded in 1976.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nApple branded its products as part of an upscale lifestyle, or “iLife,” by emphasizing sleek, minimalist, and aesthetically pleasing designs (like the iMac) that looked more like [modern art](https://www.britannica.com/art/modern-art-to-1945-2080464) than machinery.\n\nDesigned to revive Apple’s consumer and educational appeal, the iMac quickly became the all-time best-selling Mac, lifting Apple’s U.S. market share to roughly 13.5% in August 1998 from a record low of 2.6% in December 1997. Moreover, Apple had a profitable [fiscal year](https://www.britannica.com/money/fiscal-year) in 1998, its first since 1995.\n\n![Image 14: Apple iMac](https://cdn.britannica.com/36/100736-050-A6E0FCBE/Participants-social-networking-sites-multimedia-files-type.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nApple marketed its products as part of an upscale lifestyle, or “iLife,” by emphasizing designs, such as the iMac, that took up less space and looked more like modern art than machinery.\n\n© Index Open\n\nIn 2001 Apple introduced [iTunes](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iTunes), a media player and library software to store, organize, and play digital audio files converted to [MP3](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MP3) format. Later the same year, Apple began selling the [iPod](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPod), a portable MP3 player, which quickly became the market leader. (The term _[podcast](https://www.britannica.com/art/podcast)_, combining _iPod_ and _broadcast_, is used as both a noun and a verb to refer to audio or video material downloaded for portable or delayed playback.) Later models added larger storage capacities or smaller sizes, color screens, and video playback features.\n\nIn 2003 Apple began selling downloadable copies of major record company songs in MP3 format over the [Internet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet). The iPod Nano digital music player, one-fifth the size of the original iPod, was introduced by Apple in 2005. By 2006 more than one billion songs and videos had been sold through Apple’s [website](https://www.britannica.com/technology/website).\n\nIn 2007 Apple introduced the touch screen [iPhone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPhone), a [cellular telephone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/mobile-telephone#ref279849) with capabilities for playing MP3s and videos and accessing the Internet. More than just a mobile computer and media player merged with a phone, it pioneered multi-touch features that shaped the way users interact with technology.\n\n![Image 15: iPod Nano](https://cdn.britannica.com/57/90457-050-6AD457F3/iPod-Nano-music-player-size-Apple-Computer.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe iPod Nano digital music player, one-fifth the size of the original iPod, was introduced by Apple in 2005.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nAlthough the iPhone was designed for the broader consumer market, one of its biggest competitors—[BlackBerry](https://www.britannica.com/technology/BlackBerry-wireless-device), designed by the Canadian company Research in Motion (RIM)—was the dominant mobile communications device among business users.\n\n![Image 16: iPhone](https://cdn.britannica.com/94/102994-050-184833AC/telephone-addition-iPhone-Web-browser-Internet-content-2007.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nApple's touch screen iPhone, released in 2007.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nIn response, Apple sought to dislodge RIM’s position in 2007–2009 by differentiating the iPhone and innovating mobile functionalities that changed consumers’ needs and expectations, including:\n\n*   Multi-touch screen functionalities that allowed users to swipe, pinch (zoom), and type on a digital keyboard. This was a significant departure from RIM’s products, which had physical keys. \n*   Combining text and email—the functionalities the BlackBerry specialized in—with phone, Internet browsing, and iPod capabilities. \n*   Compatibility with Mac computers, giving the iPhone integrative capabilities that far exceeded those of the BlackBerry. \n*   Upgrading the iPhone in 2008 to make it compatible with 3G wireless networks and retrofitting it with [global positioning system (GPS)](https://www.britannica.com/technology/GPS) capabilities. \n*   Creating an ecosystem of third-party apps (Apple’s App Store) that accelerated the iPhone’s extended capabilities beyond devices, like the BlackBerry, that relied on in-house development.\n\nApple’s dual focus on consumer needs and business integration, positioning the iPhone as a daily extension of home and work life, eventually gained market share from RIM.\n\nBy June 19, 2009, when Apple released the [iPhone 3GS](https://www.britannica.com/topic/iPhone-3GS) (which sold one million units in the first three days), the company’s share of the [smartphone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/smartphone) market had reached about 20% (compared with about 55% for the BlackBerry line of smartphones).\n\nIn addition to hardware changes such as a three-megapixel [digital camera](https://www.britannica.com/technology/digital-camera) that could record digital videos and an internal digital compass capable of working with various mapping software, the iPhone 3GS included a new operating system, the iPhone OS 3.0.\n\nThe new system included support for voice-activated controls and peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://www.britannica.com/technology/P2P)) play of [electronic games](https://www.britannica.com/topic/electronic-game) with other iPhone users over [Wi-Fi](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Wi-Fi) Internet connections. The latter feature was part of Apple’s strategy to compete in the portable gaming market with the [Nintendo Company](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Nintendo-console)’s DS and the [Sony Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/Sony)’s PSP. The iPhone can also be used for reading electronic books, or e-books. E-books in iPhone-compatible formats can be purchased over the Internet from [electronic book](https://www.britannica.com/technology/e-book) dealers such as the iTunes store and [Amazon.com](https://www.britannica.com/money/Amazoncom).\n\nIn 2010 Apple unveiled the [iPad](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPad), a touch screen device whose size and function bridged the gap between a [laptop computer](https://www.britannica.com/technology/laptop-computer) and a smartphone. The iPad was a multimedia tablet that allowed users to operate it with the same set of finger gestures as the iPhone. Designed with a touch screen capable of displaying high-definition video, the iPad also provided access to apps via iTunes and the App Store.\n\n![Image 17: iPad](https://cdn.britannica.com/89/136089-050-BFA56CE2/iPad-2010.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe iPad was released in 2010.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nIn 2011 Apple introduced [iCloud](https://www.britannica.com/topic/iCloud), a [cloud computing](https://www.britannica.com/technology/cloud-computing) service in which a user’s applications, photographs, documents, calendars, and recently purchased music would be stored on iCloud servers and automatically updated on a user’s devices. Some analysts saw iCloud as Apple’s plan for a future in which users could dispense with the personal computer as the primary place to store data.\n\n[![Image 18: Britannica Money Logo](https://cdn.britannica.com/money/assets/Money-475x60-footer-2x.png?h=47&w=390)](https://www.britannica.com/money)\n\n[About Us](https://www.britannica.com/money/about)[Privacy Policy](https://corporate.britannica.com/privacy-policy-2)[Terms & Conditions](https://corporate.britannica.com/termsofuse.html)\n\n© 2025 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\n"

\"Apple Inc.\") logo, introduced in 1998, discontinued in 2000, and re-established in 2014[[1]](#cite_note-1)\n\n[Apple Inc.](/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\"), originally Apple Computer, Inc., is a [multinational corporation](/wiki/Multinational_corporation \"Multinational corporation\") that creates and markets [consumer electronics](/wiki/Consumer_electronics \"Consumer electronics\") and attendant computer software, and is a [digital distributor](/wiki/Digital_distribution \"Digital distribution\") of media content. [Apple's core product lines](/wiki/List_of_Apple_products \"List of Apple products\") are the [iPhone](/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\") [smartphone](/wiki/Smartphone \"Smartphone\"), [iPad](/wiki/IPad \"IPad\") [tablet computer](/wiki/Tablet_computer \"Tablet computer\"), and the [Mac](/wiki/Mac_(computer) \"Mac (computer)\") [personal computer](/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\"). The company offers its products online and has a chain of retail stores known as [Apple Stores](/wiki/Apple_Stores \"Apple Stores\"). Founders [Steve Jobs](/wiki/Steve_Jobs \"Steve Jobs\"), [Steve Wozniak](/wiki/Steve_Wozniak \"Steve Wozniak\"), and [Ronald Wayne](/wiki/Ronald_Wayne \"Ronald Wayne\") created Apple Computer Co. on April 1, 1976, to market Wozniak's [Apple I](/wiki/Apple_I \"Apple I\") desktop computer,[[2]](#cite_note-partnership-2) and Jobs and Wozniak incorporated the company on January 3, 1977,[[3]](#cite_note-Apple_incorporation-3) in [Cupertino, California](/wiki/Cupertino,_California \"Cupertino, California\").\n\nFor more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the [Apple II](/wiki/Apple_II \"Apple II\"), Macintosh, and [Power Mac](/wiki/Power_Macintosh \"Power Macintosh\") lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company [NeXT](/wiki/NeXT \"NeXT\") was bought by Apple.[[4]](#cite_note-4) The following year he became the company's interim CEO,[[5]](#cite_note-interim_CEO-5) which later became permanent.[[6]](#cite_note-norr-6) Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the [original iMac](/wiki/IMac_G3 \"IMac G3\") in 1998.\n\nWith the introduction of the successful [iPod](/wiki/IPod \"IPod\") music player in 2001 and [iTunes Music Store](/wiki/ITunes_Store \"ITunes Store\") in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop \"Computer\" from the company's name in 2007. The company is also known for its [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\") range of smartphone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the [iPod Touch](/wiki/IPod_Touch \"IPod Touch\") and then iPad. As of June 30, 2015, Apple was [the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization](/wiki/List_of_corporations_by_market_capitalization \"List of corporations by market capitalization\"),[[7]](#cite_note-7) with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018.[[8]](#cite_note-8) Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011[[9]](#cite_note-9) and $156 billion in 2012.[[10]](#cite_note-10-K-2012-10)\n\n## 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak\")]\n\n### Pre-foundation\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Pre-foundation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Blue_Box_in_museum.jpg/250px-Blue_Box_in_museum.jpg)](/wiki/File:Blue_Box_in_museum.jpg)\n\n[Steve Wozniak](/wiki/Steve_Wozniak \"Steve Wozniak\")'s \"[blue box](/wiki/Blue_box \"Blue box\")\" at the [Computer History Museum](/wiki/Computer_History_Museum \"Computer History Museum\")\n\n[Steve Jobs](/wiki/Steve_Jobs \"Steve Jobs\") and [Steve Wozniak](/wiki/Steve_Wozniak \"Steve Wozniak\"), referred to collectively as \"the two Steves\", first met in mid-1971, when their mutual friend [Bill Fernandez](/wiki/Bill_Fernandez \"Bill Fernandez\") introduced then 21-year-old Wozniak to 16-year-old Jobs.[[11]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20041–2-11)[[12]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Grady20091–2-12) Their first business partnership began in the fall of that year when Wozniak, a self-educated electronics engineer, read an article in *Esquire* magazine that described a device that could place free long-distance phone calls by emitting specific tone chirps. Wozniak started to build his original “[blue boxes](/wiki/Blue_box \"Blue box\")”, which he tested by calling the [Vatican City](/wiki/Vatican_City \"Vatican City\") pretending to be [Henry Kissinger](/wiki/Henry_Kissinger \"Henry Kissinger\") wanting to speak to the pope.[[13]](#cite_note-13) Jobs managed to sell some two hundred blue boxes for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[[11]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20041–2-11)[[12]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Grady20091–2-12) Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, \"there wouldn't have been an Apple.\"[[14]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201530-14)\n\nBy 1972, Jobs had withdrawn from [Reed College](/wiki/Reed_College \"Reed College\") and Wozniak from [UC Berkeley](/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley \"University of California, Berkeley\"). Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology, the impetus for the two Steves seems to have had another source. In his essay *From Satori to Silicon Valley* (published 1986), cultural historian [Theodore Roszak](/wiki/Theodore_Roszak_(scholar) \"Theodore Roszak (scholar)\") made the point that Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast [counterculture](/wiki/Counterculture \"Counterculture\") and the need to produce print-outs, letter labels, and databases. Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Steves' prototype models.\n\nIn 1975, the two Steves started attending meetings of the [Homebrew Computer Club](/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club \"Homebrew Computer Club\").[[15]](#cite_note-Apple_Confidential-15) New microcomputers such as the [Altair 8800](/wiki/Altair_8800 \"Altair 8800\") and the [IMSAI 8080](/wiki/IMSAI_8080 \"IMSAI 8080\") inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal circuit to make a complete computer. At the time the only [microcomputer](/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\") [CPUs](/wiki/Central_processing_unit \"Central processing unit\") generally available were the $179 [Intel 8080](/wiki/Intel_8080 \"Intel 8080\") (equivalent to $1,046 in 2024), and the $170 [Motorola 6800](/wiki/Motorola_6800 \"Motorola 6800\") (equivalent to $993 in 2024). Wozniak preferred the 6800, but both were out of his price range. So he watched, and learned, and designed computers on paper, waiting for the day he could afford a CPU.\n\nWhen [MOS Technology](/wiki/MOS_Technology \"MOS Technology\") released its $20 (equivalent to $111 in 2024) [6502](/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502 \"MOS Technology 6502\") chip in 1976, Wozniak wrote a version of [BASIC](/wiki/BASIC \"BASIC\") for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was designed by the same people who designed the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak's earlier 6800 paper-computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip.\n\nBy March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the machine and took it to a [Homebrew Computer Club](/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club \"Homebrew Computer Club\") meeting to show it off.[[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20045-16) When Jobs saw Wozniak's computer, which later became the [Apple I](/wiki/Apple_I \"Apple I\"), he was immediately interested in its commercial potential.[[17]](#cite_note-17) Initially, Wozniak intended to share schematics of the machine for free, but Jobs insisted that they should instead build and sell bare [printed circuit boards](/wiki/Printed_circuit_board \"Printed circuit board\") for the computer.[[18]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201562-18) Wozniak originally offered the design to [Hewlett-Packard](/wiki/Hewlett-Packard \"Hewlett-Packard\") (HP), where he worked at the time, but was denied by the company on five occasions.[[19]](#cite_note-AI-19) Jobs eventually convinced Wozniak to go into business together and start a new company of their own.[[20]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20045–6-20) In order to raise the money they needed to produce the first batch of printed circuit boards, Jobs sold his [Volkswagen Type 2](/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2 \"Volkswagen Type 2\") [minibus](/wiki/Minibus \"Minibus\") for $1,500, and Wozniak his [HP-65](/wiki/HP-65 \"HP-65\") [programmable calculator](/wiki/Programmable_calculator \"Programmable calculator\") for $500.[[18]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201562-18)[[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20045-16)[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22)\n\n### Apple I and company formation\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Apple I and company formation\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Apple_Garage.jpg/250px-Apple_Garage.jpg)](/wiki/File:Apple_Garage.jpg)\n\n[Steve Jobs](/wiki/Steve_Jobs \"Steve Jobs\")' parents' home on Crist Drive in [Los Altos, California](/wiki/Los_Altos,_California \"Los Altos, California\"), where Apple started its operation.[[23]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048-23) Initial work took place in his bedroom and later moved to the home's garage.[[15]](#cite_note-Apple_Confidential-15)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Apple_1_Woz_1976_at_CHM.agr_cropped.jpg/250px-Apple_1_Woz_1976_at_CHM.agr_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Apple_1_Woz_1976_at_CHM.agr_cropped.jpg)\n\nWozniak's [Apple I](/wiki/Apple_I \"Apple I\") design was sold as an assembled circuit board and without any sort of covering.

On April 12, less than two weeks after the company's formation, Wayne left Apple, selling his 10% share back to the two Steves for $800.[[28]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201565–66-28)[[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20046–8-29)\n\nAccording to Wozniak, Jobs proposed the name “Apple Computer” when he had just come back from [Robert Friedland](/wiki/Robert_Friedland \"Robert Friedland\")'s All-One Farm in Oregon.[[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20046–8-29) Jobs told [Walter Isaacson](/wiki/Walter_Isaacson \"Walter Isaacson\") that he was \"on one of my fruitarian diets,\" when he conceived of the name and thought \"it sounded fun, spirited and not intimidating ... plus, it would get us ahead of Atari in the phone book.\"[[30]](#cite_note-30)\n\nThe two Steves made a last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club and demonstrated the [Apple I](/wiki/Apple_I \"Apple I\") (AKA: The Apple Computer).[[31]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201639–40-31) [Paul Terrell](/wiki/Paul_Terrell \"Paul Terrell\"), who operated the computer store chain [Byte Shop](/wiki/Byte_Shop \"Byte Shop\"), was impressed,[[27]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwaine2014336–338-27) and gave the two Steves his card, asking them to keep in touch.[[32]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201566-32) The next day, Jobs visited Terrell at the [Mountain View](/wiki/Mountain_View,_California \"Mountain View, California\") Byte Shop store, and tried to sell him the bare circuit boards for the Apple I.[[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20046–8-29) Terrell said he was only interested in purchasing the machine fully assembled, and that he would order 50 assembled computers and pay US$500 each on delivery (equivalent to $2,800 in 2024).[[33]](#cite_note-iCon-p35-33)[[34]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20047-34)[[27]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESwaine2014336–338-27) Jobs took the purchase order from the Byte Shop to national electronic parts distributor Cramer Electronics, and ordered the components needed. When asked by the credit manager how he would pay for the parts, Jobs replied, \"I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores for 50 of my computers and the payment terms are [COD](/wiki/Cash_on_delivery \"Cash on delivery\"). If you give me the parts on net 30-day terms I can build and deliver the computers in that time frame, collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you.\"[[35]](#cite_note-35)[[36]](#cite_note-wozniak198412-36)\n\nTo verify the purchase order, the credit manager called Paul Terrell, who assured him if the computers showed up, Jobs would have more than enough money for the parts order. The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers, and delivered to Terrell on time. Terrell was surprised to receive a batch of assembled circuit boards, as he had expected complete computers with a case, monitor and keyboard.[[37]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201567–68-37)[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38) Nonetheless, he kept his word and paid the two Steves the money promised.[[39]](#cite_note-VintageNews-39)[[37]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201567–68-37)[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38)[[40]](#cite_note-iCon-p36-40)\n\nThe Apple I went on sale in July 1976 as an assembled circuit board with a retail price of $666.66.[[41]](#cite_note-41)[[42]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20047–8-42)[[43]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201569–70-43) Wozniak later said he had had no idea about the relation between the number and the [mark of the beast](/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast \"Mark of the beast\"), and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits.[[39]](#cite_note-VintageNews-39) About 200 units of the Apple I were eventually sold.[[44]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200414-44)\n\nThe Apple I computer had some notable features, including the use of a [TV](/wiki/Television \"Television\") display, whereas many machines had no display at all. This was not like the displays of later machines; the text was displayed at 60 characters per second – still faster than the teleprinters of contemporary machines of that era. The machine had [bootstrap](/wiki/Booting \"Booting\") code on [ROM](/wiki/Read-only_memory \"Read-only memory\"), making it easier to start up. At the insistence of Paul Terrell, Wozniak designed a cassette interface for loading and saving programs, at the then-rapid pace of 1200 bit/s. The simple machine was a masterpiece of design using far fewer parts than anything in its class, and earned Wozniak his reputation as a designer.\n\nJobs looked for investments to expand the business,[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38) but banks were reluctant to lend him money; the idea of a computer for ordinary people seemed absurd at the time. In August 1976, Jobs approached his former boss at Atari, [Nolan Bushnell](/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell \"Nolan Bushnell\"), who recommended that he meet with [Don Valentine](/wiki/Don_Valentine \"Don Valentine\"), the founder of [Sequoia Capital](/wiki/Sequoia_Capital \"Sequoia Capital\").[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38) Valentine was not interested in funding Apple, but in turn introduced Jobs to [Mike Markkula](/wiki/Mike_Markkula \"Mike Markkula\"), a millionaire who had worked under him at [Fairchild Semiconductor](/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor \"Fairchild Semiconductor\").[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38) Markkula saw great potential in the two Steves, and became an [angel investor](/wiki/Angel_investor \"Angel investor\") of their company.[[45]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201645–47-45) He invested $92,000 in Apple out of his own property while securing a $250,000 (equivalent to $1,380,000 in 2024) line of credit from Bank of America.[[45]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201645–47-45)[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38) In return, Markkula received a one-third stake in Apple.[[45]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201645–47-45) Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977.[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38) The new corporation bought out the partnership the two Steves had formed nine months earlier.[[46]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201577–78-46)\n\nIn February 1977, Markkula recruited [Michael Scott](/wiki/Michael_Scott_(Apple) \"Michael Scott (Apple)\") from [National Semiconductor](/wiki/National_Semiconductor \"National Semiconductor\") to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple Computer, as the two Steves were both insufficiently experienced and he was not interested in taking that position himself.[[47]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200411-47)[[48]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201648–50-48)\nThat same month, Wozniak resigned from his job at [Hewlett-Packard](/wiki/Hewlett-Packard \"Hewlett-Packard\") to work full-time for Apple.[[46]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201577–78-46)[[49]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200421-49)\n\n### Apple II\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Apple II\")]\n\nMain article: [Apple II (original)](/wiki/Apple_II_(original) \"Apple II (original)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Apple_II_Plus_cropped.jpg/250px-Apple_II_Plus_cropped.jpg)](/wiki/File:Apple_II_Plus_cropped.jpg)\n\n[Apple II Plus](/wiki/Apple_II_Plus \"Apple II Plus\"), designed primarily by Wozniak\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Disk_II.jpg/250px-Disk_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Disk_II.jpg)\n\n[Disk II](/wiki/Disk_II \"Disk II\"), also designed by Wozniak\n\nAlmost as soon as Apple had started selling its first computers, Wozniak moved on from the Apple I and began designing a greatly improved computer: the [Apple II](/wiki/Apple_II_(original) \"Apple II (original)\").[[45]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201645–47-45) Wozniak completed a working prototype of the new machine by August 1976.[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer20048–10-38)[[50]](#cite_note-50) The two Steves presented the Apple II computer to the public at the first [West Coast Computer Faire](/wiki/West_Coast_Computer_Faire \"West Coast Computer Faire\") on April 16 and 17, 1977.

In the May 1977 issue of [*Byte*](/wiki/Byte_(magazine) \"Byte (magazine)\"), Wozniak said of the Apple II design, \"To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive.\"[[51]](#cite_note-wozniak197705-51)\n\nThe Apple II went on sale on June 10, 1977, with a retail price of $1,298.[[52]](#cite_note-52) The computer's main internal difference from its predecessor was a completely redesigned TV interface, which held the display in memory. Now not only useful for simple text display, the Apple II included graphics and, eventually, color. During the development of the Apple II, Jobs pressed for a well-designed plastic case and built-in keyboard, with the idea that the machine should be fully packaged and ready to run out of the box.[[53]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201571–74-53) This was almost the case for the Apple I computers, but one still needed to plug various parts together and type in the code to run BASIC. Jobs wanted the Apple II case to be \"simple and elegant\", and hired an industrial designer named [Jerry Manock](/wiki/Jerry_Manock \"Jerry Manock\") to produce such a case design.[[53]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson201571–74-53) Apple employee #5 [Rod Holt](/wiki/Rod_Holt \"Rod Holt\") developed the [switching power supply](/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply \"Switched-mode power supply\").[[54]](#cite_note-wozorgAppleII-54) While early Apple II models use ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded in 1978 by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch [floppy disk](/wiki/Floppy_disk \"Floppy disk\") drive and interface called the [Disk II](/wiki/Disk_II \"Disk II\").[[55]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200413–15-55)[[56]](#cite_note-56) The Disk II system was designed by Wozniak and released with a retail price of $495.[[55]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200413–15-55)\n\nIn 1979, the Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for what became the first [killer application](/wiki/Killer_application \"Killer application\") of the business world: [VisiCalc](/wiki/VisiCalc \"VisiCalc\"), a [spreadsheet](/wiki/Spreadsheet \"Spreadsheet\").[[55]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200413–15-55) So important that the Apple II became what [John Markoff](/wiki/John_Markoff \"John Markoff\") described as a \"VisiCalc accessory\",[[57]](#cite_note-markoff19820705-57) the application unexpectedly created a business market for the computer; Wozniak later said that small businesses bought 90% of Apple IIs, not the hobbyists he and Jobs had expected.[[58]](#cite_note-byte198501-58) It gave home users an additional reason to buy Apples: Compatibility with the office.[[55]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200413–15-55) Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to [Commodore](/wiki/Commodore_64 \"Commodore 64\") and [Tandy](/wiki/Tandy_Computers \"Tandy Computers\").[[59]](#cite_note-59)[[60]](#cite_note-60)\n\nThe Apple II was one of the three \"[1977 Trinity](/wiki/History_of_personal_computers#1977_and_the_emergence_of_the_\"Trinity\" \"History of personal computers\")\" computers generally credited with creating the [home computer](/wiki/Home_computer \"Home computer\") market (the other two being the [Commodore PET](/wiki/Commodore_PET \"Commodore PET\") and the Tandy Corporation [TRS-80](/wiki/TRS-80 \"TRS-80\")).[[61]](#cite_note-61) A number of different models of the Apple II were built thereafter, including the [Apple IIe](/wiki/Apple_IIe \"Apple IIe\") and [Apple IIGS](/wiki/Apple_IIGS \"Apple IIGS\"),[[62]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200417–20-62) which continued in public use for nearly two decades.

The Apple III was designed to take on the business environment in an attempt to compete with [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") in the business and corporate computing market.[[65]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Grady20096-65) The development of the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Wendell Sander,[[66]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200481–82-66) and was subsequently developed by a committee headed by Jobs.[[67]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200441–42-67) The Apple III was first announced on May 19, 1980, with a retail price ranging from $4,340\nto $7,800, and released in November 1980.[[67]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer200441–42-67)\n\nThe Apple III was a conservative design for the era, however Jobs wanted the heat generated by the electronics to be dissipated through the [chassis](/wiki/Chassis \"Chassis\") of the machine rather than by the more usual cooling fan. The case was not sufficient to cool the components and the Apple III was prone to overheating, causing the [integrated circuit](/wiki/Integrated_circuit \"Integrated circuit\") chips to disconnect from the motherboard. Customers who contacted Apple customer service were told to raise their computers into the air, and then let go to cause the integrated circuits to fall back into place. Thousands of Apple III computers were recalled. A new model was introduced in 1983 to try to rectify the problems, but the damage was already done.\n\n### Apple IPO\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Apple IPO\")]\n\nIn the July 1980 issue of *[Kilobaud Microcomputing](/wiki/Kilobaud_Microcomputing \"Kilobaud Microcomputing\")*, publisher [Wayne Green](/wiki/Wayne_Green \"Wayne Green\") stated that \"the best consumer ads I've seen have been those by Apple. They are attention-getting, and they must be prompting sale.\"[[68]](#cite_note-green198007-68) In August, the *[Financial Times](/wiki/Financial_Times \"Financial Times\")* reported that\n\n> Apple Computer, the fast growing Californian manufacturer of small computers for the consumer, business and educational markets, is planning to go public later this year. [It] is the largest private manufacturer in the U.S. of small computers. Founded about five years ago as a small workshop business, it has become the second largest manufacturer of small computers, after the [Radio Shack](/wiki/Radio_Shack \"Radio Shack\") division of the [Tandy](/wiki/Tandy_Corporation \"Tandy Corporation\") company.[[69]](#cite_note-69)\n\nOn December 12, 1980, Apple went public on the [NASDAQ](/wiki/NASDAQ \"NASDAQ\") stock exchange with the ticker symbol \"AAPL\", selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for [stock splits](/wiki/Stock_split \"Stock split\") as of November 30, 2020[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit)),[[70]](#cite_note-Apple_FAQ-70) generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since [Ford Motor Company](/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company \"Ford Motor Company\") in 1956.[[71]](#cite_note-EDNAAPLSTOCK-71) Several venture capitalists cashed out, reaping billions in long-term capital gains. By the end of the day, the stock rose to $29 per share and 300 millionaires were created, including the two Steves.[[72]](#cite_note-CNBC-72)[[73]](#cite_note-DEDIPO-73) Around this time Wozniak offered $10 million of his own stock to early Apple employees, something Jobs refused to do.[[72]](#cite_note-CNBC-72) Apple's market cap was $1.778 billion at the end of its first day of trading.[[71]](#cite_note-EDNAAPLSTOCK-71)[[73]](#cite_note-DEDIPO-73)\n\nIn January 1981, Apple held its first shareholders meeting as a public company in the [Flint Center](/wiki/Flint_Center \"Flint Center\"), a large auditorium at nearby [De Anza College](/wiki/De_Anza_College \"De Anza College\") (which is often used for symphony concerts) to handle the larger numbers of shareholders post-IPO. The business of the meeting had been planned so that the voting could be staged in 15 minutes or less. In most cases, voting proxies are collected by mail and counted days or months before a meeting. In this case, after the IPO, many shares were in new hands.\n\nJobs started his prepared speech, but after being interrupted by voting several times, he dropped his prepared speech and delivered a long, emotionally charged talk about betrayal, lack of respect, and related topics.[[74]](#cite_note-74) The results of the vote were surprising: a young programmer, [Randy Wigginton](/wiki/Randy_Wigginton \"Randy Wigginton\"), received enough votes to be added to Apple's board of directors, through the use of [cumulative voting](/wiki/Cumulative_voting \"Cumulative voting\") by a few major shareholders.\n\n### Competition from the IBM PC\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Competition from the IBM PC\")]\n\nBy August 1981 Apple was among the three largest microcomputer companies, perhaps having replaced Radio Shack as the leader;[[75]](#cite_note-hogan19810831-75) revenue in the first half of the year had already exceeded 1980's $118 million, and *InfoWorld* reported that lack of production capacity was constraining growth.[[76]](#cite_note-hogan19810914state-76) Because of VisiCalc, businesses purchased 90% of Apple II computers;[[77]](#cite_note-Mace1984-77)[[58]](#cite_note-byte198501-58) large customers especially preferred Apple.[[78]](#cite_note-mcmullen19840221-78)\n\n[IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") entered the personal computer market that month with the [IBM PC](/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer \"IBM Personal Computer\")[[79]](#cite_note-pollack19810813-79)[[80]](#cite_note-isaacson2013-80) in part because it did not want products without IBM logos on customers' desks,[[81]](#cite_note-pollack19830327-81) but Apple had many advantages. While IBM began with one microcomputer, little available hardware or software, and a couple of hundred dealers, Apple had five times as many dealers in the US and an established international distribution network. The Apple II had an [installed base](/wiki/Installed_base \"Installed base\") of more than 250,000 customers, and hundreds of independent developers offered software and peripherals; at least ten databases and ten word processors were available, while the PC had no databases and one word processor.[[82]](#cite_note-rosen19811130-82)\n\nThe company's customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty. *[BYTE](/wiki/BYTE \"BYTE\")* in 1984 stated that[[83]](#cite_note-lemmons198412-83)\n\n> There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.\n> Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the [American Dream](/wiki/American_Dream \"American Dream\"). Even as a large corporation, Apple plays [David to IBM's Goliath](/wiki/David_and_Goliath \"David and Goliath\"), and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.\n\nThe magazine noted that the loyalty was not entirely positive for Apple; customers were willing to overlook real flaws in its products, even while holding the company to a higher standard than for competitors.[[83]](#cite_note-lemmons198412-83) The Apple III was an example of its autocratic reputation among dealers[[78]](#cite_note-mcmullen19840221-78) that one described as \"Apple arrogance\".[[84]](#cite_note-dvorak19831128-84) After examining a PC and finding it unimpressive, Apple confidently purchased a full-page advertisement in *The Wall Street Journal* with the headline \"Welcome, IBM. Seriously\".[[85]](#cite_note-iw19811005-85)[[80]](#cite_note-isaacson2013-80) The company prioritized the III for three years, spending what Wozniak estimated as $100 million on marketing and R&D while not improving the Apple II to compete with the PC, as doing so could hurt III sales.[[58]](#cite_note-byte198501-58)\n\nMicrosoft head [Bill Gates](/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") was at Apple headquarters the day of IBM's announcement and later said \"They didn't seem to care. It took them a full year to realize what had happened\".[[80]](#cite_note-isaacson2013-80) The PC almost completely ended sales of the III, the company's most comparable product. The II still sold well,[[81]](#cite_note-pollack19830327-81) with Apple being the leading computer manufacturer in the United States where 7 million units were sold between 1978 and 1982.[[86]](#cite_note-86) But by 1983, the PC surpassed the Apple II as the best-selling personal computer.[[87]](#cite_note-sanger19850805-87) IBM recruited the best Apple dealers while avoiding the discount [grey market](/wiki/Grey_market#Electronics \"Grey market\") they disliked.[[81]](#cite_note-pollack19830327-81) The head of a retail chain said \"It appears that IBM had a better understanding of why the Apple II was successful than had Apple\".[[78]](#cite_note-mcmullen19840221-78) [Gene Amdahl](/wiki/Gene_Amdahl \"Gene Amdahl\") predicted that Apple would be another of the many \"brash young companies\" that IBM had defeated.[[88]](#cite_note-greenwald19830711-88)\n\nBy 1984 the press called the two companies archrivals,[[89]](#cite_note-bulman19841105-89) but IBM had $4 billion in annual PC revenue, more than twice that of Apple and as much as the sales of it and the next three companies combined.[[90]](#cite_note-libes198509-90) A *[Fortune](/wiki/Fortune_(magazine) \"Fortune (magazine)\")* survey found that 56% of American companies with personal computers used IBM PCs, compared to 16% for Apple.[[91]](#cite_note-Kennedy_1985-91) Small businesses, schools, and some homes became the II's primary market.[[77]](#cite_note-Mace1984-77)\n\n### Xerox PARC and the Lisa\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Xerox PARC and the Lisa\")]\n\nMain article: [Apple Lisa](/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Apple_Lisa-2-IMG_1730_modified.png/250px-Apple_Lisa-2-IMG_1730_modified.png)](/wiki/File:Apple_Lisa-2-IMG_1730_modified.png)\n\n[Apple Lisa](/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\")\n\nApple Computer's business division was focused on the Apple III, another iteration of the text-based computer. Simultaneously the Lisa group worked on a new machine that would feature a completely different interface and introduce the words *[mouse](/wiki/Computer_mouse \"Computer mouse\")*, *[icon](/wiki/Icon_(computing) \"Icon (computing)\")*, and *[desktop](/wiki/Desktop_metaphor \"Desktop metaphor\")* into the [lexicon](/wiki/Lexicon \"Lexicon\") of the computing public. In return for the right to buy US$1,000,000 of pre-[IPO](/wiki/Initial_public_offering \"Initial public offering\") stock, Xerox granted Apple Computer three days access to the PARC facilities. After visiting PARC, they came away with new ideas that would complete the foundation for Apple Computer's first [GUI](/wiki/Graphical_user_interface \"Graphical user interface\") computer, the [Apple Lisa](/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\").[[92]](#cite_note-92)[[93]](#cite_note-93)[[94]](#cite_note-94)[[95]](#cite_note-95) The first iteration of Apple's [WIMP](/wiki/WIMP_(computing) \"WIMP (computing)\") interface was a floppy disk where files could be spatially moved around. After months of usability testing, Apple designed the Lisa interface of windows and icons. The Lisa was introduced in 1983 at a cost of US$9,995 (equivalent to $31,600 in 2024). Because of the high price, Lisa failed to penetrate the business market.\n\n### Macintosh and the \"1984\" commercial\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Macintosh and the \\\"1984\\\" commercial\")]\n\nMain articles: [History of the Macintosh](/wiki/History_of_the_Macintosh \"History of the Macintosh\") and [1984 (advertisement)](/wiki/1984_(advertisement) \"1984 (advertisement)\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Macintosh%2C_Google_NY_office_computer_museum_cropped.png/250px-Macintosh%2C_Google_NY_office_computer_museum_cropped.png)](/wiki/File:Macintosh,_Google_NY_office_computer_museum_cropped.png)\n\n[Macintosh 128K](/wiki/Macintosh_128K \"Macintosh 128K\")\n\nBy 1984 computer dealers saw Apple as the only clear alternative to IBM's influence;[[96]](#cite_note-sanger19841119-96) some even promoted its products to reduce dependence on the PC.[[81]](#cite_note-pollack19830327-81) The company announced the [Macintosh 128K](/wiki/Macintosh_128K \"Macintosh 128K\") to the press in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with magazines in December.[[97]](#cite_note-97) Its debut was announced by a single national broadcast of a US$1.5 million television commercial, \"[1984](/wiki/1984_(advertisement) \"1984 (advertisement)\")\" (equivalent to $4,500,000 in 2024).

Because the machine was entirely designed around the GUI, existing text-mode and [command-driven applications](/wiki/Command_line_interface \"Command line interface\") had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten; this was a challenging undertaking that many [software developers](/wiki/Software_developer \"Software developer\") shied away from, and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984 [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\")'s [Multiplan](/wiki/Multiplan \"Multiplan\") migrated over from [MS-DOS](/wiki/MS-DOS \"MS-DOS\"), followed by [Microsoft Word](/wiki/Microsoft_Word \"Microsoft Word\") in January 1985;[[117]](#cite_note-hotwyu-117) in return for Microsoft's commitment to Macintosh, Apple agreed to not provide [software development kits](/wiki/Software_development_kit \"Software development kit\") and prototype computers to companies with applications competing with Microsoft's.[[118]](#cite_note-farber20140123-118) In 1985, [Lotus Software](/wiki/Lotus_Software \"Lotus Software\") introduced [Lotus Jazz](/wiki/Lotus_Jazz \"Lotus Jazz\") after the success of [Lotus 1-2-3](/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3 \"Lotus 1-2-3\") for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.[[119]](#cite_note-119) Apple introduced [Macintosh Office](/wiki/Macintosh_Office \"Macintosh Office\") the same year with the [lemmings ad](/wiki/Lemmings_(television_commercial) \"Lemmings (television commercial)\"), infamous for insulting potential customers. It was not successful.[[120]](#cite_note-Worst_Business-120)\n\nFor a special post-election edition of *[Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek \"Newsweek\")* in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue.[[121]](#cite_note-121) Apple also ran a \"Test Drive a Macintosh\" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO [John Sculley](/wiki/John_Sculley \"John Sculley\") to raise the price from US$1,995 (equivalent to $6,000 in 2024) to US$2,495 (equivalent to $7,600 in 2024).[[120]](#cite_note-Worst_Business-120)\n\n### Jobs and Wozniak leave Apple\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Jobs and Wozniak leave Apple\")]\n\nBy early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC[[114]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson2015185–187-114)[[115]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201684–88-115) triggered a power struggle between Jobs and CEO [John Sculley](/wiki/John_Sculley \"John Sculley\"), who had been hired two years earlier by Jobs[[122]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004156-122)[[123]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIsaacson2015153–154-123) using the famous line, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[[124]](#cite_note-124) Sculley and Jobs' visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored [open architecture](/wiki/Open_architecture \"Open architecture\") computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the [closed architecture](/wiki/Closed_architecture \"Closed architecture\") Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the Board Jobs' Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.[[125]](#cite_note-robbeloth198510_11-125) Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 [annual meeting](/wiki/Annual_meeting \"Annual meeting\") did not mention the Apple II division or employees. This frustrated Wozniak, who left active employment at Apple in the spring of that year to pursue other ventures, stating that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\" and sold most of his stock.[[126]](#cite_note-rice19850415-126)[[127]](#cite_note-wozemployee-127)[[128]](#cite_note-128) Despite these grievances, Wozniak left the company amicably and as of January 2018 continues to represent Apple at events or in interviews,[[127]](#cite_note-wozemployee-127) receiving a stipend over the years for this role estimated in 2006 to be $120,000 per year.[[129]](#cite_note-iWoz-129) Wozniak also remained an Apple shareholder following his departure.[[130]](#cite_note-wozstock-130)\n\nWozniak's first venture after leaving Apple was founding [CL 9](/wiki/CL_9 \"CL 9\") in 1985 and creating the first programmable [universal remote](/wiki/Universal_remote \"Universal remote\") control two years later, called the \"CORE\", stating that \"I never felt like I was turning my back on my own company [Apple].\" He told Apple's director of engineering [Wayne Rosing](/wiki/Wayne_Rosing \"Wayne Rosing\") about his decision to step away from the company, but not his longtime business partner and friend Steve Jobs. Wozniak guessed that Jobs first heard the news from an article in *[The Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\")* where he mentioned that he wasn't leaving because he was disgruntled with Apple, but that he was excited to build a new remote control. The article nevertheless included some of Wozniak's criticisms of Apple, and Wozniak later said \"it was an accident, but it's been picked up by every book and every bit of history [since].\"[[129]](#cite_note-iWoz-129): 289\n\nIn April 1985, Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the general manager of the Macintosh division, and gained unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[[131]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlender201687–92-131)[[122]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004156-122) Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.[[132]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004156–157-132) Informed by [Jean-Louis Gassée](/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e \"Jean-Louis Gassée\"), Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [coup](/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Other \"Coup d'état\") and called an emergency executive meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[[132]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004156–157-132)\n\nJobs, while taking the position of chairman of the firm, had no influence over Apple's direction and resigned in September 1985, taking a number of Apple employees with him to found [NeXT Inc.](/wiki/NeXT \"NeXT\")[[133]](#cite_note-133) In a show of defiance at being set aside by Apple Computer, Jobs sold all but one of his 6.5 million shares in the company for $70 million. Jobs then acquired the [visual effects](/wiki/Visual_effects \"Visual effects\") house, [Pixar](/wiki/Pixar \"Pixar\") for $5M (equivalent to $14,300,000 in 2024). NeXT Inc. built computers with futuristic designs and the UNIX-derived [NEXTSTEP](/wiki/NEXTSTEP \"NEXTSTEP\") operating system. NeXTSTEP eventually developed into Mac OS X. While not a commercial success, due in part to its high price, the NeXT computer introduced important concepts to the history of the personal computer, including serving as the initial platform for [Tim Berners-Lee](/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee \"Tim Berners-Lee\") as he was developing the [World Wide Web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\").[[134]](#cite_note-134)\n\nSculley reorganized the company, unifying sales and marketing in one division and product operations and development in another.[[135]](#cite_note-135)[[125]](#cite_note-robbeloth198510_11-125) Despite initial marketing difficulties, the Macintosh brand was eventually a success for Apple, due to its introduction of [desktop publishing](/wiki/Desktop_publishing \"Desktop publishing\") (and later [computer animation](/wiki/Computer_animation \"Computer animation\")) through Apple's partnership with [Adobe Systems](/wiki/Adobe_Systems \"Adobe Systems\"), which introduced the [laser printer](/wiki/Laser_printer \"Laser printer\") and [Adobe PageMaker](/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker \"Adobe PageMaker\").

A month later on June 16, Apple stock split for the first time in a 2:1 split. Between March 1988 and January 1989, Apple undertook five acquisitions, including software companies Network Innovations,[[136]](#cite_note-136) Styleware,[[137]](#cite_note-137) Nashoba Systems,[[138]](#cite_note-138) and Coral Software,[[139]](#cite_note-139) as well as satellite communications company Orion Network Systems.[[140]](#cite_note-140)\n\nApple continued to sell both lines of its computers, the Apple II and the Macintosh. A few months after introducing the Mac, Apple released a compact version of the Apple II called the [Apple IIc](/wiki/Apple_IIc \"Apple IIc\"). And in 1986 Apple introduced the [Apple IIGS](/wiki/Apple_IIGS \"Apple IIGS\"), an Apple II positioned as something of a hybrid product with a mouse-driven, Mac-like operating environment. Even with the release of the first Macintosh, Apple II computers remained the main source of income for Apple for years.[[141]](#cite_note-141)\n\n### The Mac family\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: The Mac family\")]\n\nSee also: [Timeline of Macintosh models](/wiki/Timeline_of_Macintosh_models \"Timeline of Macintosh models\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Powerbook_100_pose.jpg/250px-Powerbook_100_pose.jpg)](/wiki/File:Powerbook_100_pose.jpg)\n\n[PowerBook 100](/wiki/PowerBook_100 \"PowerBook 100\") (1991)\n\nAt the same time, the Mac was becoming a product family of its own. The original model evolved into the [Mac Plus](/wiki/Macintosh_Plus \"Macintosh Plus\") in 1986 and spawned the [Mac SE](/wiki/Macintosh_SE \"Macintosh SE\") and the [Mac II](/wiki/Macintosh_II \"Macintosh II\") in 1987 and the [Mac Classic](/wiki/Macintosh_Classic \"Macintosh Classic\") and [Mac LC](/wiki/Macintosh_LC \"Macintosh LC\") in 1990. Meanwhile, Apple attempted its first portable Macs: the failed [Macintosh Portable](/wiki/Macintosh_Portable \"Macintosh Portable\") in 1989 and then the more popular [PowerBook](/wiki/PowerBook \"PowerBook\") in 1991, a landmark product that established the modern form and [ergonomic](/wiki/Ergonomics \"Ergonomics\") layout of the laptop. Popular products and increasing revenues made this a good time for Apple. [MacAddict](/wiki/MacAddict \"MacAddict\") magazine has called 1989 to 1991 the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh. On February 19, 1987, Apple registered the \"[Apple.com](/wiki/Apple.com \"Apple.com\")\" domain name, making it one of the first hundred companies to register a [.com](/wiki/.com \".com\") address on the nascent Internet.[[142]](#cite_note-142)\n\n### Early-mid-1990s\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Early-mid-1990s\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Apple_Newton_MessagePad_100_with_stylus.jpg/250px-Apple_Newton_MessagePad_100_with_stylus.jpg)](/wiki/File:Apple_Newton_MessagePad_100_with_stylus.jpg)\n\n[Apple Newton MessagePad](/wiki/MessagePad \"MessagePad\") (1993)\n\nIn the late 1980s, Apple's fiercest technological rivals were the [Amiga](/wiki/Amiga \"Amiga\") and [Atari ST](/wiki/Atari_ST \"Atari ST\") platforms. But computers based on the [IBM PC](/wiki/IBM_PC \"IBM PC\") were far more popular than all three, and by the 1990s, they finally had a comparable [GUI](/wiki/GUI \"GUI\") thanks to [Windows 3.0](/wiki/Windows_3.0 \"Windows 3.0\"), and were out-competing Apple.\n\nApple's response to the PC threat was a profusion of new Macintosh lines including [Quadra](/wiki/Macintosh_Quadra \"Macintosh Quadra\"), [Centris](/wiki/Macintosh_Centris \"Macintosh Centris\"), and [Performa](/wiki/Macintosh_Performa \"Macintosh Performa\"). These new lines were marketed poorly by what was now \"arguably one of the worst-managed companies in the industry\".[[143]](#cite_note-alsop19960205-143) There were too many models, differentiated by very minor graduations in [technical specifications](/wiki/Technical_specifications \"Technical specifications\"). The profusion of arbitrary model numbers confused consumers and hurt Apple's reputation for simplicity. Resellers like [Sears](/wiki/Sears,_Roebuck_and_Company \"Sears, Roebuck and Company\") and [CompUSA](/wiki/CompUSA \"CompUSA\") often failed to sell or even competently display these Macs. Inventory grew as Apple consistently underestimated demand for popular models and overestimated demand for others.[[143]](#cite_note-alsop19960205-143)\n\nIn 1991, Apple partnered with long-time competitor [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") and [Motorola](/wiki/Motorola \"Motorola\") to form the [AIM alliance](/wiki/AIM_alliance \"AIM alliance\"), with the ultimate goal to create a revolutionary new computing platform, known as [PReP](/wiki/PReP \"PReP\"), using IBM and Motorola hardware and Apple software. As the first step, Apple started the [Power Macintosh](/wiki/Power_Macintosh \"Power Macintosh\") line in 1994, using [PowerPC](/wiki/PowerPC \"PowerPC\") processors from Motorola and IBM. The [RISC](/wiki/RISC \"RISC\") architecture of these processors differed substantially from the Motorola [680X0](/wiki/68000 \"68000\") series used by previous Macs. Parts of Apple's operating system were rewritten to allow some older Mac software to run in [emulation](/wiki/Emulator \"Emulator\") on the PowerPC series.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*] Apple refused IBM's offer to purchase the company, but later unsuccessfully sought another offer from IBM,[[144]](#cite_note-markoff19970901-144) and at one point was \"hours away\" from an acquisition by [Sun Microsystems](/wiki/Sun_Microsystems \"Sun Microsystems\").[[143]](#cite_note-alsop19960205-143)[[145]](#cite_note-preimesberger20110225-145) In 1993, Apple released the [Newton](/wiki/Newton_(platform) \"Newton (platform)\"), a failed early [personal digital assistant](/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant \"Personal digital assistant\") (PDA).\n\n### Need for a new OS\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Need for a new OS\")]\n\nIn 1994 Apple launched [eWorld](/wiki/EWorld \"EWorld\"), an online service providing email, news and a bulletin board system to replace [AppleLink](/wiki/AppleLink \"AppleLink\"). It was shut down in 1996.[[146]](#cite_note-146) In 1995, to achieve deeper market penetration and extra revenue, Apple officially began licensing the Mac OS and Macintosh ROMs to 3rd party manufacturers. The \"[Clonintoshes](/wiki/Clonintosh \"Clonintosh\")\" competed with Apple's own Mac's and reduced Apple's sales.[[147]](#cite_note-lemjosh-147) Apple had market share of over 10% until Jobs was re-hired in 1997 as interim CEO to replace Gil Amelio, and found a loophole to terminate the Macintosh OS licensing program. Macintosh's market share fell to around 3%.[[148]](#cite_note-148)\n\nDuring the 90's, \"project *Pink*\" had Apple and IBM collaborating to develop a new operating system, named *[Taligent](/wiki/Taligent \"Taligent\")* to replace *[System 7](/wiki/System_7 \"System 7\")*. Infighting resulted in Apple leaving the project and IBM finishing it. Apple started project *[Copland](/wiki/Copland_(operating_system) \"Copland (operating system)\")*, another effort to replace System 7, but it was affected by [Feature creep](/wiki/Feature_creep \"Feature creep\") then [Development hell](/wiki/Development_hell \"Development hell\") due to software planned for Taligent being reworked for Copland. Ultimately Copland was scrapped.[[149]](#cite_note-149) With the Copland project in disarray, Apple decided it needed to acquire another company's operating system. Candidates considered were [Sun](/wiki/Sun_Microsystems \"Sun Microsystems\")'s [Solaris](/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system) \"Solaris (operating system)\") and [Windows NT](/wiki/Windows_NT \"Windows NT\"). Hancock was in favor of Solaris, while Amelio preferred Windows.

The new direct sales outlet was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.[[156]](#cite_note-156)[[157]](#cite_note-157)\n\n### Microsoft deal\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Microsoft deal\")]\n\nAt the 1997 [Macworld Expo](/wiki/Macworld_Expo \"Macworld Expo\"), Jobs announced that Apple would begin a partnership with [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\"), with terms including a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release [Microsoft Office](/wiki/Microsoft_Office \"Microsoft Office\") for Macintosh, and a US$150 million investment in Apple. The long-standing dispute over whether Windows infringed Apple patents was settled,[[158]](#cite_note-Microsoft_investment-158) and [Internet Explorer](/wiki/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac \"Internet Explorer for Mac\") would ship as the Macintosh's default browser, with the user able to have a preference. Microsoft chairman [Bill Gates](/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") appeared on-screen explaining plans for developing Mac software, and expressing excitement to be helping Apple return to success. Jobs addressed the audience:\n\n> If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that's great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don't do a good job, it's not somebody else's fault, it's our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we'd like their software.\n> So, the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I'm concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again.[[159]](#cite_note-159)\n\nThe day before the announcement Apple had a market cap of $2.46 billion,[[160]](#cite_note-160) and had ended its previous quarter with quarterly revenues of US$1.7 billion and cash reserves of US$1.2 billion,[[161]](#cite_note-161) making the US$150 million amount of the investment largely symbolic.

The original iMac integrated a CRT display and CPU into a streamlined, translucent plastic body. The line became a sales smash, moving about one million units each year. It helped re-introduce Apple to the media and public and announced the company's new emphasis on the design and aesthetics of its products.\n\nIn 1999, Apple introduced the [Power Mac G4](/wiki/Power_Mac_G4 \"Power Mac G4\"), which utilized the Motorola-made PowerPC 7400 containing a 128-bit instruction unit known as [AltiVec](/wiki/AltiVec \"AltiVec\"), its flagship processor line.

Since March 2011, the largest storage capacity for an iPod has been 160 gigabytes.[[163]](#cite_note-163) Speaking to software developers on June 6, 2005, Jobs said the company's share of the entire portable music device market stood at 76%.[[164]](#cite_note-164)\n\nThe iPod gave an enormous lift to Apple's financial results.[[165]](#cite_note-165) In the quarter ending March 26, 2005, Apple earned US$290 million, or 34¢ a share, on sales of US$3.24 billion. The year before in the same quarter, Apple earned just US$46 million, or 6¢ a share, on revenue of US$1.91 billion.\n\n### Moving on from colored plastics and the PowerPC G3\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit section: Moving on from colored plastics and the PowerPC G3\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/IMac_G4_sunflower7.png/250px-IMac_G4_sunflower7.png)](/wiki/File:IMac_G4_sunflower7.png)\n\n[iMac G4](/wiki/IMac_G4 \"IMac G4\") (2002)\n\nIn early 2002, Apple unveiled a completely redesigned iMac, using the G4 processor and LCD display. The new [iMac G4](/wiki/IMac_G4 \"IMac G4\") design had a white hemispherical base and a flat panel all-digital display supported by a swiveling chrome neck. After several iterations increasing the processing speed and screen sizes from 15\" to 17\" to 20\" the iMac G4 was discontinued and replaced by the [iMac G5](/wiki/IMac_G5 \"IMac G5\") in the summer of 2004.\n\nLater in 2002, Apple released the [Xserve](/wiki/Xserve \"Xserve\") [1U](/wiki/Rack_unit \"Rack unit\") [rack mounted](/wiki/Rack_mount \"Rack mount\") server. Originally featuring two G4 chips, the Xserve was unusual for Apple in two ways. It represented an earnest effort to enter the enterprise computer market, and it was cheaper than competitors' similar machines. This was largely due to Fast ATA drives as opposed to the SCSI hard drives used in traditional rack-mounted servers. Apple later released the [Xserve RAID](/wiki/Xserve_RAID \"Xserve RAID\"), a 14 drive [RAID](/wiki/RAID \"RAID\") that was again cheaper than competing systems.\n\nIn mid-2003, Jobs launched the [Power Mac G5](/wiki/Power_Mac_G5 \"Power Mac G5\"), based on [IBM](/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")'s [G5 processor](/wiki/PowerPC_970 \"PowerPC 970\"). Its all-metal [anodized aluminum](/wiki/Anodized_aluminum \"Anodized aluminum\") chassis finished Apple's transition away from colored plastics in their computers. Apple claims this was the first 64-bit computer sold to the general public. The Power Mac G5 was used by Virginia Tech to build its prototype [System X](/wiki/System_X_(supercomputer) \"System X (supercomputer)\") supercomputing cluster, which at the time was considered the third-fastest supercomputer in the world. It cost only US$5.2 million to build, far less than the previous No. 3 and other ranking supercomputers. Apple's Xserves were updated to use the G5 as well. They replaced the Power Mac G5 machines as the main building block of [Virginia Tech](/wiki/Virginia_Tech \"Virginia Tech\")'s [System X](/wiki/System_X_(supercomputer) \"System X (supercomputer)\"), which was ranked in November 2004 as the world's seventh-fastest [supercomputer](/wiki/Supercomputer \"Supercomputer\").[[166]](#cite_note-166)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/IMac_G5_-_Frontal_view.png/250px-IMac_G5_-_Frontal_view.png)](/wiki/File:IMac_G5_-_Frontal_view.png)\n\n[iMac G5](/wiki/IMac_G5 \"IMac G5\") (2004)\n\nA new iMac based on the G5 processor was unveiled August 31, 2004, and was made available in mid-September. This model dispensed with the base altogether, placing the CPU and the rest of the computing hardware behind the flat-panel screen, which is suspended from a streamlined aluminum foot. This new iMac, dubbed the [iMac G5](/wiki/IMac_G5 \"IMac G5\"), was the \"world's thinnest desktop computer\",[[167]](#cite_note-167) measuring in at around two inches (around 5 centimeters).[[168]](#cite_note-168)\n\nIn 2004, after creating a sizable financial base to work with, the company began experimenting with new parts from new suppliers. Apple could produce new designs quickly, and released the iPod Video, then the iPod Classic, and eventually the iPod touch and iPhone. On April 29, 2005, Apple released [Mac OS X v10.4](/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.4 \"Mac OS X v10.4\") \"Tiger\".\n\nApple's successful [PowerBook](/wiki/PowerBook \"PowerBook\") and [iBook](/wiki/IBook \"IBook\") relied on previous generation G4 architecture produced by [Freescale Semiconductor](/wiki/Freescale_Semiconductor \"Freescale Semiconductor\"), a spin-off from Motorola. IBM engineers had some success in making their PowerPC G5 processor consume less power and run cooler, but not enough to run in iBook or PowerBook formats. In October 2005, Apple released the Power Mac G5 Dual featuring a Dual-Core processor – two cores in one rather than two separate processors. The Power Mac G5 Quad uses two Dual-Core processors. The Power Mac G5 Dual cores run individually at 2.0 GHz or 2.3 GHz. The Power Mac G5 Quad cores run individually at 2.5 GHz, and all variations have a graphics processor with 256-bit memory bandwidth.[[169]](#cite_note-169)\n\n### Retail store expansion\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit section: Retail store expansion\")]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Apple_Store_Ginza_%282006.05%29.jpg/250px-Apple_Store_Ginza_%282006.05%29.jpg)](/wiki/File:Apple_Store_Ginza_(2006.05).jpg)\n\nApple Store in Ginza district, [Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo \"Tokyo\")\n\nInitially, [Apple Stores](/wiki/Apple_Store \"Apple Store\") were only in the United States, but in late 2003, Apple opened its first Apple Store abroad, in Tokyo's [Ginza](/wiki/Ginza \"Ginza\") district. It was followed by a store in [Osaka](/wiki/Osaka,_Osaka \"Osaka, Osaka\"), Japan in August 2004. In 2005, Apple opened stores in [Nagoya](/wiki/Nagoya,_Aichi \"Nagoya, Aichi\"), the [Shibuya](/wiki/Shibuya,_Tokyo \"Shibuya, Tokyo\") district of Tokyo, [Fukuoka](/wiki/Fukuoka,_Fukuoka \"Fukuoka, Fukuoka\"), and [Sendai](/wiki/Sendai,_Miyagi \"Sendai, Miyagi\"). A store opened in [Sapporo](/wiki/Sapporo,_Hokkaid%C5%8D \"Sapporo, Hokkaidō\") in 2006. Apple's first European store opened in London, on [Regent Street](/wiki/Regent_Street \"Regent Street\"), in November 2004. A store in the [Bullring](/wiki/Bull_Ring,_Birmingham \"Bull Ring, Birmingham\") shopping centre in [Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham \"Birmingham\") opened in April 2005, and the [Bluewater shopping centre](/wiki/Bluewater_Shopping_Centre \"Bluewater Shopping Centre\") in [Dartford](/wiki/Dartford \"Dartford\"), Kent opened in July 2005. Apple opened its first store in Canada in the middle of 2005 at the [Yorkdale Shopping Centre](/wiki/Yorkdale_Shopping_Centre \"Yorkdale Shopping Centre\") in [North York](/wiki/North_York \"North York\"), [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\"). Later in 2005 Apple opened the [Meadowhall](/wiki/Meadowhall_Centre \"Meadowhall Centre\") Store in [Sheffield](/wiki/Sheffield \"Sheffield\") and the [Trafford Centre](/wiki/Trafford_Centre \"Trafford Centre\") Store in [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\"), UK. Later additions in the London area include [Brent Cross](/wiki/Brent_Cross \"Brent Cross\") (January 2006), [Westfield](/wiki/Westfield_London \"Westfield London\") in Shepherd's Bush (September 2008), and [Covent Garden](/wiki/Covent_Garden \"Covent Garden\") (August 2010), which at 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) was, as of 2015, the largest Apple Store in the world.[[170]](#cite_note-170)\n\nApple opened several \"larger\" stores in October 2004 to capture markets where demand does not necessarily dictate a full-scale store. The first of these stores was opened at [Stanford Shopping Center](/wiki/Stanford_Shopping_Center \"Stanford Shopping Center\") in [Palo Alto, California](/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California \"Palo Alto, California\"). These stores are only one half the square footage of the smallest normal store.\n\n### Apple and \"i\" Web services\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit section: Apple and \\\"i\\\" Web services\")]\n\nIn 2000, Apple introduced iTools, a set of free web-based tools that included an email account, internet greeting cards called iCards, a Web site review service called [iReview](/wiki/IReview \"IReview\"), and \"KidSafe\", to prevent children browsing inappropriate websites. The latter two services were canceled because of lack of success. iCards and email were integrated into Apple's [.Mac](/wiki/.Mac \".Mac\") subscription-based service introduced in 2002 and discontinued in mid-2008 to make way for MobileMe, coinciding with the iPhone 3G release. MobileMe, at the same US$99.00 annual subscription as its dotMac predecessor, featured \"push\" services to instantly and automatically send emails, contacts and calendar updates directly to users' iPhones. Controversy around the release of MobileMe resulted in downtime and a significantly longer release window. Apple extended existing MobileMe subscriptions by 30 days free-of-charge.[[171]](#cite_note-171) At the WWDC event in June 2011, Apple announced [iCloud](/wiki/ICloud \"ICloud\"), keeping most MobileMe services but dropping iDisk, Gallery, and iWeb. It added Find my Mac, iTunes Match, Photo Stream, Documents & Data Backup, and iCloud backup for iOS devices. The service requires iOS 5 and OS X 10.7 Lion.\n\n### iTunes Store\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=28 \"Edit section: iTunes Store\")]\n\nMain article: [iTunes Store](/wiki/ITunes_Store \"ITunes Store\")\n\nThe [iTunes Music Store](/wiki/ITunes_Store \"ITunes Store\") was launched in April 2003, with 2 million downloads in the first 16 days. Music was purchased through the [iTunes](/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\") application, which was initially Macintosh-only; in October 2003, support for [Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\") was added. Initially, the music store was only available in the United States due to licensing restrictions.\n\nIn June 2004 Apple opened its iTunes Music Store in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. A version for the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\") version opened October 2004, but it was not initially available in the [Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\") due to the intransigence of the [Irish Recorded Music Association](/wiki/Irish_Recorded_Music_Association \"Irish Recorded Music Association\") (IRMA) but was opened there a few months later on Thursday, January 6, 2005. A version for Canada opened in December 2004. On May 10, 2005, the iTunes Music Store was expanded to [Denmark](/wiki/Denmark \"Denmark\"), Norway, [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden \"Sweden\"), and [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland \"Switzerland\").\n\nOn December 16, 2004, Apple sold its 200 millionth song on the iTunes Music Store to Ryan Alekman from [Belchertown, Massachusetts](/wiki/Belchertown,_Massachusetts \"Belchertown, Massachusetts\"). The download was *[The Complete U2](/wiki/The_Complete_U2 \"The Complete U2\")*, by [U2](/wiki/U2 \"U2\").[[172]](#cite_note-172) Just under three months later Apple sold its 300 millionth song on March 2, 2005.[[173]](#cite_note-173) On July 17, 2005, the iTunes Music Store sold its 500 millionth song.[[174]](#cite_note-174) At that point, songs were selling at an accelerating annualized rate of more than 500 million.\n\nOn October 25, 2005, the iTunes Store went live in Australia, with songs selling for [A$](/wiki/Australian_dollar \"Australian dollar\")1.69 each, albums at (generally) A$16.99 and music videos and Pixar short films at A$3.39. Before the loophole was closed, people in [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\") were briefly able to buy music from the Australian store On February 23, 2006, the iTunes Music Store sold its 1 billionth song.[[175]](#cite_note-175)\n\nThe iTunes Music Store changed its name to iTunes Store on September 12, 2006, when it began offering video content (TV shows and movies) for sale. Since iTunes' inception, it has sold over 2 billion songs, 1.2 billion of which were sold in 2006. Since downloadable TV and movie content was added 50 million TV episodes and 1.3 million movies have been downloaded. In early 2010, Apple celebrated the 10 billionth song downloaded from the iTunes Music Store.[[176]](#cite_note-176)\n\n### Intel transition\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=29 \"Edit section: Intel transition\")]\n\nMain article: [Mac transition to Intel processors](/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Intel_processors \"Mac transition to Intel processors\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/MacBook_Pro.png/250px-MacBook_Pro.png)](/wiki/File:MacBook_Pro.png)\n\n[MacBook Pro](/wiki/MacBook_Pro \"MacBook Pro\") Intel-based (2006)\n\nIn a keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would produce Intel-based Macintosh computers beginning in 2006.[[177]](#cite_note-177) Jobs confirmed rumors that the company had been secretly producing versions of [Mac OS X](/wiki/MacOS \"MacOS\") for both PowerPC and Intel processors over the past 5 years, and that the transition to Intel processor systems would last until the end of 2007. Rumors of cross-platform compatibility had been spurred by the fact that Mac OS X is based on [OPENSTEP](/wiki/OPENSTEP \"OPENSTEP\"), an operating system that was available for many platforms. Apple's own [Darwin](/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system) \"Darwin (operating system)\"), the [open source](/wiki/Open-source_software \"Open-source software\") underpinnings of Mac OS X, was also available for Intel's x86 architecture.[[178]](#cite_note-178)[[179]](#cite_note-179)[[180]](#cite_note-180)\n\nOn January 10, 2006, the Intel-based [iMac](/wiki/IMac \"IMac\") and [MacBook Pro](/wiki/MacBook_Pro \"MacBook Pro\") were introduced,[[181]](#cite_note-181)[[182]](#cite_note-182) based on the [Intel Core](/wiki/Intel_Core \"Intel Core\") Duo platform. They came alongside news that Apple would complete the transition to Intel processors on all hardware by the end of 2006, a year ahead of the originally quoted schedule.\n\n## 2007–2011: Apple Inc., iPhone, iOS, iPad\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=30 \"Edit section: 2007–2011: Apple Inc., iPhone, iOS, iPad\")]\n\nOn January 9, 2007, Apple Computer, Inc. shortened its name to simply Apple Inc. In his [Macworld Expo](/wiki/Macworld_Expo \"Macworld Expo\") keynote address, Jobs explained that with their current product mix consisting of the iPod and Apple TV as well as their Macintosh brand, Apple really wasn't just a computer company anymore. At the same address, Jobs revealed a product that would revolutionize an industry in which Apple had never previously competed: the Apple [iPhone](/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\"). The iPhone combined Apple's first widescreen iPod with the world's first mobile device boasting visual voicemail, and an internet communicator able to run a fully-functional version of Apple's web browser, [Safari](/wiki/Safari_(web_browser) \"Safari (web browser)\"), on the then-named [iPhone OS](/wiki/IOS_version_history#Releases \"IOS version history\") (later renamed [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\")).\n\n### iOS evolution: iPhone and iPad\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit section: iOS evolution: iPhone and iPad\")]\n\nMain articles: [iOS](/wiki/IOS \"IOS\"), [iPhone](/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\"), and [iPad](/wiki/IPad \"IPad\")\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/IPhone_First_Generation.jpg/250px-IPhone_First_Generation.jpg)](/wiki/File:IPhone_First_Generation.jpg)\n\nThe original [iPhone](/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation) \"IPhone (1st generation)\") (2007)\n\nThe first version of the iPhone became publicly available on June 29, 2007, in selected countries/markets. It was another 12 months before the [iPhone 3G](/wiki/IPhone_3G \"IPhone 3G\") became available on July 11, 2008. Apple announced the [iPhone 3GS](/wiki/IPhone_3GS \"IPhone 3GS\") on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the U.S., Canada, and major European countries on June 19. This 12-month iteration cycle has continued with the [iPhone 4](/wiki/IPhone_4 \"IPhone 4\") model arriving in similar fashion in 2010, a Verizon model was released in February 2011, and a Sprint model in October 2011, shortly after Jobs' death.\n\nOn February 10, 2011, the iPhone 4 was made available on both Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Now two iPod types are multi-touch: the iPod nano and the iPod touch, a big advance in technology. Apple TV currently has a 2nd-generation model, which is 4 times smaller than the original Apple TV. Apple has also gone wireless, selling a wireless trackpad, keyboard, mouse, and external hard drive. Wired accessories are still available.\n\nThe Apple [iPad](/wiki/IPad \"IPad\") was announced on January 27, 2010, with retail availability commencing in April and systematically growing in markets throughout 2010. The iPad fits into Apple's iOS product line, being twice the screen size of an iPhone without the phone abilities. While there were initial fears of product cannibalization the FY2010 financial results released in Jan 2011 included commentary of a reverse 'halo' effect, where iPad sales were leading to increased sales of iMacs and MacBooks.[[183]](#cite_note-183)\n\n### Resurgence compared to Microsoft\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit section: Resurgence compared to Microsoft\")]\n\nSince 2005, Apple's revenues, profits, and stock price have grown significantly. On May 26, 2010, Apple's stock market value overtook Microsoft's,[[184]](#cite_note-184)[[185]](#cite_note-185)[[186]](#cite_note-186) and Apple's revenues surpassed those of Microsoft in the third quarter of 2010.[[187]](#cite_note-187)[[188]](#cite_note-188) After giving their results for the first quarter of 2011, Microsoft's net profits of $5.2 billion were lower for the quarter than those of Apple, which earned $6 billion in net profit for the quarter.[[189]](#cite_note-Apple_Microsoft_revenue-189)[[190]](#cite_note-190) The late April announcement of profits by the companies marked the first time in 20 years that Microsoft's profits had been lower than Apple's,[[191]](#cite_note-Apple_Microsoft_20_years-191) a situation described by *[Ars Technica](/wiki/Ars_Technica \"Ars Technica\")* as \"unimaginable a decade ago\".[[189]](#cite_note-Apple_Microsoft_revenue-189)\n\n*[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")* reported that one of the reasons for the change was because PC software, where Microsoft dominates, has become less important compared to the tablet and smartphone markets, where Apple has a strong presence.[[191]](#cite_note-Apple_Microsoft_20_years-191) One reason for this was a surprise drop in PC sales in the quarter.[[191]](#cite_note-Apple_Microsoft_20_years-191) Another issue for Microsoft was that its online search business had lost a lot of money, with a loss of $700 million in the first quarter of 2010.[[191]](#cite_note-Apple_Microsoft_20_years-191)\n\n## 2011–2020: Restructuring and Apple Watch\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=History_of_Apple_Inc.&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit section: 2011–2020: Restructuring and Apple Watch\")]\n\nSee also: [Apple car project](/wiki/Apple_car_project \"Apple car project\")\n\nOn March 2, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPad's second-generation model, the [iPad 2](/wiki/IPad_2 \"IPad 2\"). Like the 4th-generation iPod Touch and iPhone, the iPad 2 comes with a front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing camera, along with three new apps that utilize these new features: Camera, [FaceTime](/wiki/FaceTime \"FaceTime\"), and [Photo Booth](/wiki/Photo_Booth \"Photo Booth\"). On August 24, Jobs resigned from his position as CEO,[[192]](#cite_note-192) with Tim Cook taking his place.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Apple announced structural changes to increase collaboration between hardware, software, and services.[[193]](#cite_note-193) This involved the departure of [Scott Forstall](/wiki/Scott_Forstall \"Scott Forstall\"), responsible for the launch of iOS (iPhone OS at the time of launch), who was replaced with [Craig Federighi](/wiki/Craig_Federighi \"Craig Federighi\") as head of iOS and OS X teams. [Jony Ive](/wiki/Jony_Ive \"Jony Ive\") became head of HI (Human Interface), whilst [Eddy Cue](/wiki/Eddy_Cue \"Eddy Cue\") was announced as head of online services including Siri and Maps. The most notable short term difference of this restructuring was the launch of [iOS 7](/wiki/IOS_7 \"IOS 7\"), the first version of the operating system to use a drastically different design to its predecessors, headed by Jony Ive,[[194]](#cite_note-194) followed by [OS X Yosemite](/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite \"OS X Yosemite\") a year later with a similar design.\n\nDuring this time, Apple released the [iPhone 5](/wiki/IPhone_5 \"IPhone 5\"), the first iPhone to have a screen larger than 3.5\",[[195]](#cite_note-195) the [iPod Touch 5](/wiki/IPod_Touch_5 \"IPod Touch 5\") with a 4\" screen, the [iPhone 5S](/wiki/IPhone_5S \"IPhone 5S\") with fingerprint scanning technology in the form of [Touch ID](/wiki/Touch_ID \"Touch ID\"), and [iPhone 6](/wiki/IPhone_6 \"IPhone 6\") and [iPhone 6 Plus](/wiki/IPhone_6_Plus \"IPhone 6 Plus\"), with screens at 4.7\" and 5.5\".

The company somewhat admitted to this practice in 2017, saying the phones were slowed to respond to the [decay](/wiki/Capacity_loss \"Capacity loss\") of iPhones' [lithium-ion batteries](/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery \"Lithium-ion battery\"), which made it harder for the batteries to reach the phones' expected power demands.[[208]](#cite_note-208) The [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic \"COVID-19 pandemic\") heavily effected China, hurting Apple financially, because they invested into China enough to become increasingly dependent on the country.[[209]](#cite_note-O'Flaherty-209) Chinese factories closed and demand for Apple products went down.[[210]](#cite_note-210) However, they recovered and eventually reached a US$2 trillion market cap later that year.[[211]](#cite_note-211) The [iPhone 12](/wiki/IPhone_12 \"IPhone 12\"), [12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max](/wiki/IPhone_12_Pro \"IPhone 12 Pro\") were introduced, being the first iPhones to support [5G](/wiki/5G \"5G\") connectivity.[[212]](#cite_note-212) The company also started using its own [Apple silicon](/wiki/Apple_silicon \"Apple silicon\") processors in Macs, instead of chips made by Intel.[[213]](#cite_note-213)[[214]](#cite_note-214)\n\nIn April 2021, the M1-powered iPad was launched, along with a new M1-powered iMac offered in 7 colors, recalling the [iMacs offered in 5 colors](/wiki/IMac_G3#Model_line-up \"IMac G3\") announced in 1999. Apple launched a GPS tracking device called [AirTag](/wiki/AirTag \"AirTag\") that uses the Apple's [Find My](/wiki/Find_My \"Find My\") device network. In 2021 and 2022, Apple repeated its pattern of introducing four new iPhones in September, with 2021's [iPhone 13](/wiki/IPhone_13 \"IPhone 13\") and [iPhone 13 Pro](/wiki/IPhone_13_Pro \"IPhone 13 Pro\") lines and 2022's [iPhone 14](/wiki/IPhone_14 \"IPhone 14\") and [iPhone 14 Pro](/wiki/IPhone_14_Pro \"IPhone 14 Pro\") lines.

The first product to feature these improvements, named [Apple Intelligence](/wiki/Apple_Intelligence \"Apple Intelligence\"), is planned to be the [iPhone 15 Pro](/wiki/IPhone_15_Pro \"IPhone 15 Pro\") running iOS 18.[[233]](#cite_note-233) Criticism was leveled towards the plan to incorporate recorded user inputs into ChatGPT's [data set](/wiki/Data_set \"Data set\").[[234]](#cite_note-234) Apple did not pay OpenAI for these features, believing that exposure to OpenAI products will already financially benefit them.[[235]](#cite_note-235) The announcement improved Apple's stock, temporarily making them the world's most valuable company instead of Microsoft.[[236]](#cite_note-236)\n\nIn 2024, Apple was sued by two female employees seeking class action who claimed that the company's hiring and performance-review practices are biased against women.[[237]](#cite_note-237) Meanwhile, the [National Labor Relations Board](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board \"National Labor Relations Board\") (NLRB) charged Apple with violations of the [National Labor Relations Act of 1935](/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act_of_1935 \"National Labor Relations Act of 1935\") in spring and fall of 2024.

Wright](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/wright_gavin.jpg)\n\nBy\n*   [Gavin Wright](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Gavin-Wright)\n\n Published: Sep 11, 2024\n\nWhat is Apple?\n--------------\n\nApple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer Inc.) is an American computer and consumer electronics company famous for creating the iPhone, iPad and Macintosh computers. Apple is one of the largest companies globally with a market cap of more than $3 trillion.\n\nApple devices are renowned for their design aesthetic and attention to detail. Tight integration between [hardware](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/hardware) and [software](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/software) gives their [systems](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/system) a performance advantage over competitor systems with similar specifications.\n\nApple rose to its position as a market leader by correctly positioning its products. They didn't invent [personal computers](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/personal-computer-PC), graphical user interfaces (GUIs), [mp3](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/MP3-MPEG-1-Audio-Layer-3) players, [smartphones](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/smartphone), [smartwatches](https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/smartwatch) or [tablets](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/tablet-PC). Instead, they produced some of the first versions of these products that were refined, easy to use and well-designed, which led to wide market adoption.\n\n![Image 2: Photo of Apple devices](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineImages/access_0318-apple_products_mobile.png)\n\nApple desktop and mobile devices \n\nApple product lines\n-------------------\n\nApple offers numerous products and services. A few of its major offerings today include:\n\n**Mac computer****.** The [Macintosh](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Macintosh), or Mac, is Apple's line of personal computers. Its main product types are the iMac all-in-one desktop, Mac mini standard desktop, Mac Studio media-focused desktop, Mac Pro professional production workstation desktop, MacBook Air consumer laptop and MacBook Pro professional laptop.\n\n![Image 3: Photo of MacBook Air](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/macbook_air_m2-f_mobile.jpg)\n\nMacBook Air laptop \n\nAll Mac computers use the [macOS](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Mac-OS) operating system. Since 2020, they use the \"M\" series CPUs designed by Apple based on [ARM](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/ARM-processor) architecture. These chips have been praised for their excellent performance and power efficiency. Mac computers are popular with students and creative professionals for their elevated style and ease of use. Computer programmers might also use them because the underlying operating system is based on Unix and is [POSIX](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/POSIX-Portable-Operating-System-Interface) compatible. Due to the lack of built-in central management and high cost, Mac computers have historically been unpopular in the workplace. Still, the introduction of [Zero Trust](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/zero-trust-model-zero-trust-network), [BYOD](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/BYOD-bring-your-own-device) and third-party tools such as [Jamf](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/tip/Explore-Jamfs-products-and-features-for-Apple-management) have begun to make them more acceptable to IT administrators.\n\n**iPhone and iPad.** The [iPhone](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/iPhone) is Apple's smartphone line, and the [iPad](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/iPad) is its tablet. The iPhone was the first smartphone to receive mass market adoption due to its ease of use, built-in app store and [capacitive](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/capacitive-touch-screen) multitouch touchscreen. The iPhone uses the \"A\" series mobile CPU, and recent iPads use the same \"M\" series CPUs as Mac computers. Their operating systems [iOS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/iOS) and iPadOS, are based on the same Unix kernel as macOS but have a touch-focused interface.\n\n**Apple Watch.**The[Apple Watch](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/Apple-Watch)is a smartwatch and fitness tracker. It can monitor health signals, such as ECG, blood oxygen and heart rate data. It can also act as a digital key, allowing users to unlock, lock and start compatible cars. The Apple Watch runs on the[watchOS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/Apple-Watch-OS-Apple-Watch-operating-system) operating system.\n\n**Apple AirPods.**AirPods are wireless headphones that sync with Apple devices through Bluetooth. Apple users can listen to audio including music, movies and messages through AirPods. Additionally, users can take phone calls through AirPods and use Siri. The AirPods Pro 2 can be used as an over-the-counter hearing aid for those who do not suffer from severe hearing loss, but to use this feature, users need to take a test to analyze hearing loss.\n\n**Apple TV.**[Apple TV](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/Apple-TV-Apple-TV-4)is a television set-top box and streaming media device. AppleTV has voice control capabilities and can integrate with other Apple devices via Airplay. It also has video conferencing features and the ability to locate the Siri remote.

The third founding member, Ronald Wayne, quickly sold his ownership to Jobs and Wozniak. Their first product was the Apple I [microcomputer](https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/microcomputer), which they built in Jobs' family garage. It was sold as a single board with [CPU](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/processor) and [RAM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAM-random-access-memory), but without other basic components such as a keyboard and monitor.\n\nThe Apple II was introduced in 1977. It was a commercial success due to its ease of use, color graphics and VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program. Its popularity propelled Apple to become the leading computer manufacturer in America and led to one of the largest IPOs of its time.\n\nSteve Jobs became obsessed with GUIs after seeing Xerox's early Alto system. This led him to add a GUI to the next Apple system, the Apple Lisa. Under Jobs' direction, the Apple Lisa development went far over time and over budget, which led to his being removed as the head of the project. The Apple Lisa was eventually released in 1983 but was a commercial flop due to its high price and lack of software.\n\nJobs moved to head development of the Macintosh computer. An advertisement heralded its release in 1984 during the Super Bowl with a dystopian 1984 theme, which was a direct challenge to the market leader [IBM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitchannel/definition/IBM-International-Business-Machines). This advertisement is widely considered one of the greatest ads ever shown on television. Despite this, the Macintosh had poor initial sales due to its high price and low performance.\n\n![Image 5: Photo of Apple iPad series of tablets](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/apple_ipad_air_availability_ipad_family_10162020_half_column_mobile.jpg)\n\nApple iPad series \n\nThe conflict between Steve Jobs and then Apple CEO John Sculley over the release of the Macintosh led to Jobs being removed from all duties by the board of directors. This caused Jobs to leave Apple and start a new company, NeXT computers. At about this time, Steve Wozniak also stepped down from a leadership role at Apple due to personal reasons.\n\nDespite the loss of its founding members, Apple continued to do well in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This was largely due to continuing sales of the Apple II and the eventual success of an upgraded Macintosh in the creative market. During this time, Adobe products, such as [Photoshop](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Photoshop) and Publisher, and other high-quality [digital publishing](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/desktop-publishing) software were only available on Macintosh.\n\nSeveral factors led to Apple losing profitability, and almost going bankrupt in the mid-1990s. Apple experimented with releasing other consumer electronics products. The most disastrous of which was the Newton tablet. Apple also faced stiff competition from lower-cost Microsoft Windows-based PCs, especially with the release of [Windows](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Windows) 95. The Macintosh operating system was also starting to show its age and did not properly support Multitasking.\n\nDesperate to return to profitability and find a new operating system for its computers, Apple purchased Steve Jobs' new company, NeXT in early 1997. Jobs was then named interim CEO of Apple after the former CEO was ousted in mid-1997. He was able to refocus Apple on its core computer business and save it from bankruptcy. In 1998 the iMac was introduced. It was designed by Jonathan Ive and was popular for its friendly colorful gumdrop shape. Apple also introduced video editing and CD/DVD mastering software, cementing Macintosh's role in digital media production.\n\nMac OS X was released in 2001. It was based on the operating system work of NeXT and used the stable and secure BSD Unix [kernel](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/kernel). Also, in 2001, Apple released the iPod to wide acclaim, establishing Apple's place as a trendsetter in consumer electronics.\n\nThe iPhone was introduced in 2007, becoming one of the first popular smartphones. The next year App Store launched, allowing third-party developers to sell and market their apps to users. The iPhone was followed by the popular iPhone 4 and iPad in 2010.\n\n![Image 6: Chart of Apple's iPhone evolution](https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/evolution_of_apple_iphone-f_mobile.png)\n\nEvolution of the Apple iPhone \n\nIn early 2011 Steve Jobs took a leave of absence; naming Tim Cook as the new CEO of Apple. Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011.\n\nApple has continued to release new products and expanded services in recent years. Apple has switched to using its own in-house designed CPUs, first in iPhone and now in its Macintosh line of computers. It also offers media [streaming services](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/video-streaming-service) through Apple TV+ and Apple Music. It is expected that Apple might enter new markets soon, with rumors that a [virtual reality](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/virtual-reality)/[augmented reality](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/augmented-reality-AR) headset and a [self-driving automobile](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/driverless-car) in development.\n\n_See how_[_Apple Mac performance and features boost its appeal to business_](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/news/252521279/Apple-Mac-performance-features-boost-business-appeal)_and explore what_[_role Apple TV can serve within a business_](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/tip/What-role-can-Apple-TV-serve-within-a-business)_.

Jobs and Wozniak wanted to make computers small enough for people to have them in their homes or offices. Simply put, they wanted a computer that was user-friendly.[1](#note1)\n\nJobs and Wozniak started out building the Apple I in Jobs' garage and sold them without a monitor, keyboard, or casing (which they decided to add on in 1977). The Apple II revolutionized the computer industry with the introduction of the first-ever color graphics. Sales jumped from $7.8 million in 1978 to $117 million in 1980, the year Apple went public.[2](#note2)\n\nWozniak left Apple in 1983 due to a diminishing interest in the day-to-day running of Apple Computer. Jobs then hired PepsiCo's John Sculley to be president. However, this move backfired and after much controversy with Sculley, Jobs left in 1985 and went on to new and bigger things. He founded his own company NeXT Software and he also bought Pixar from George Lucas, which would later become a huge success in computer animation of such movies as *Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc.,* and *Finding Nemo.*[3](#note3)\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s, Apple was still doing well and in 1990 it posted its highest profits yet. This was, however, mostly due to the plans that Jobs had already set in motion before he left, most notably his deal with a tiny company by the name of Adobe, creator of the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). Together the two companies created the phenomenon known as desktop publishing.[4](#note4)\n\nBack in 1985 Sculley turned down an appeal from Microsoft founder Bill Gates to license its software. This decision would later come back to haunt him because Microsoft, whose Windows operating system (OS) featured a graphical interface similar to Apple's, became their toughest competition in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s.\n\nOver the course of a few years, Apple's market share suffered slowly after its peak in 1990 and by 1996, experts believed the company to be doomed. It was not until 1997, when Apple was desperately in need of an operating system, that it bought out NeXT Software (Jobs' company) and the board of directors decided to ask for some help from an old friend: Steve Jobs. Jobs became an interim CEO, or iCEO as he called himself (Jobs was not officially the CEO until 2000). Jobs decided to make some changes around Apple. He forged an alliance with Microsoft to create a Mac version of its popular office software. Not long after this decision was the turning point for the company. Jobs revamped the computers and introduced the iBook (a personal laptop) followed by iPod, an mp3 player, which became market leader.\n\nThe iPhone, a touch screen cellular phone, introduced in 2007 was one of the world' most successful products and the company has released several new versions since. Not long after the announcement of iPhone and Apple TV, the company dropped \"Computer\" from its name to become \"Apple Inc.,\" indicating that it is about more than just computers. Other popular products include iPad tablet and Apple Watch. Most recently Apple has expanded its services segments with its credit card (Apple Card), Apple News for news, Apple Arcade for games and the Apple TV+ for streaming original content produced by Apple.[5](#note5) Steve Jobs died October 5, 2011, but Apple continues on with his legacy with Tim Cook at the helm as the CEO.

It then lacked a built-in keyboard, monitor, case or any other Human Interface Devices (which was later added in 1977).\n\nBy the end of 1978, Apple was one of the fastest-growing companies in the United States, with its products carried by over 100 dealers.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBy 1978 Wozniak had invented the Apple Disk II, at the time the fastest and cheapest disk drive offered by any computer manufacturer.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBy the end of the year sales were up 400 percent from 1978, at over 35,000 computers.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nMost notably, in 1979 two Bostonians—Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston—introduced the first personal computer spreadsheet, VisiCalc, creating what would later be known as a “killer app” (application): a software program so useful that it propels hardware sales.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nApple Fortran, introduced in March 1980, led to the further development of software, particularly technical and educational applications.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nApple’s profits and size grew at a historic rate: by 1980 the company netted over $100 million and had more than 1,000 employees.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBy the year 1980, the competition was growing difficult with IBM and Microsoft in the market.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nAbout a year later, in January 1981 to be exact, Apple held its first meeting for shareholders as a public company.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nApples customer service at the time would tell clients to “raise the computer 6 inches in the air and then let go”, in hopes of the components falling back into place. It was finally released in March 1981.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nA second offering of 2.6 million shares quickly sold out in May 1981.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIBM had waited for the personal computer market to grow before introducing its own line of personal computers, the IBM PC, in 1981.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nWozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as low-cost-computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBy January 1982, 650,000 Apple computers had been sold worldwide.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\n1982 Apple becomes the first personal computer company to reach $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe Lisa division would be plagued by infighting, and in 1982 Jobs was pushed off the project.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nWozniak left Apple in 1983 due to a diminishing interest in the day-to-day running of Apple Computers.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nLisa was released in 1983 to much fanfare, but disastrous sales — it was too expensive and didn't have enough software support.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software titles.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBy the beginning of May 1984, 70,000 units were shipped as a result of the “1984” commercial.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nPageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nHowever, what saved the Mac in those early years was Apple’s 1985 introduction of an affordable laser printer along with Aldus Corporation’s PageMaker, the Mac’s first killer app.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nAfter the departures of Jobs and Wozniak, Sculley worked to improve the Macintosh in 1985 by quadrupling the RAM and introducing the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nAnother innovation was a software database called HyperCard, which Apple included free with every Macintosh starting in 1987.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nApple was reorganized in August 1988 into four operating divisions: Apple USA, Apple Europe, Apple Pacific, and Apple Products.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBy 1988, over one million Macintosh computers had been sold, with 70 percent of sales to corporations.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn May 1989 Apple announced plans for its new operating system, System 7, which would be available to users the next year and allow Macintoshes to run tasks on more than one program simultaneously.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nDuring this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn July 1990, Robert Puette, former head of Hewlett-Packard's personal computer business, became head of the Apple USA division.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 1990 the court found in favor of Apple in the Xerox case.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 1990, desktop Macs accounted for 11 percent of the PCs sold through United States computer dealers.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn a rather surprising development, Apple and IBM announced an alliance in 1991.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe bill for such forward-looking surgery was great, however, and in 1991 profits were off 35 percent.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\n1991 PowerBook line of notebook computers is released.\n\nIn 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nSculley was replaced by Michael Spindler in 1993.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nScully was forced out of his leadership position by Apple's board of directors in 1993.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nAfter the launch of the LC, Apple began encouraging developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away from Apple II. The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe first PowerPC run by Macintosh was released in 1994 but Apple’s misfortune continued.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nWith Spindler at the helm Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform; PReP), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBy 1995, Apple had $1 billion worth of unfilled orders, and investors took note of the embarrassing miscue.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nAfter Spindler's much publicized mistake of 1995, Apple's directors were ready to hand the leadership reins to someone new.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nHowever, by 1996 Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of their own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator, Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.\n\nOnly weeks away from bankruptcy, Apple's board decided NeXTSTEP was a better choice for its next operating system and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $429 million, bringing back Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997, and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nFortune magazine offered its analysis, referring to Apple in its March 3, 1997 issue as \"Silicon Valley's paragon of dysfunctional management.\"\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nJobs convinced the board to make him the interim CEO in July 1997.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nOn July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nJobs also ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nNovember 1997 marked the launch of the Apple Store which was an application sever conceived and designed when Apple bought out NeXT.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nOn November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Store website, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing that had been successfully used by PC manufacturer Dell.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nDuring the 1997 Macworld Expo, Jobs announced Apple was joining hands with Microsoft to create new versions of Microsoft for the Macintosh.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nLC CCall Number: HD9696.C64 A8633 1997 Catalog Record: 97014371 Publisher's Description Publisher-supplied Biographical Information Sample Text\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 1998, Apple purchased Macromedia’s Key Grip Software Project, thus expanding its video editing market.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nApple acquired of Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was renamed Final Cut Pro when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook, a laptop for consumers.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe development of Key Grip also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 1999, sales grew a modest 3.2 percent, but the newfound health of the company was evident in a 94 percent gain in net income, as Apple's profits swelled to $601 million.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nNext, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple would sell as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product, and used the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nJobs became an interim CEO, or iCEO as he called himself (Jobs was not officially the CEO until 2000). Jobs decided to make some changes around Apple.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nMay 2001 marked the beginning of a new era for Apple.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn May 2001 the company opened its first two Apple Store retail locations in Virginia and California, offering an improved presentation of the company's products.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nOn October 23, 2001, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 2001 Apple introduced iTunes, a computer program for playing music and for converting music to the compact MP3 digital format commonly used in computers and other digital devices.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe system 7 was behind giving colour to the Macintosh OS and was used until 2001 when OS X was released.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nBrookfield, CT: Twenty-First Century Books, 2001.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\n2001 would be a pivotal year for the Apple with the company making three announcements that would change the course of the company.\n\nA 10 GB model was introduced in mid-2002, followed by the iPod Mini, iPod Shuffle, and iPod Nano, together representing a massive new source of revenue for the company.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositing application Shake, as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\n\"Everybody Wants a Piece of the iPod,\" America's Intelligence Wire, October 27, 2003.\n\n2003 was the year that the iTunes store was launched with over 2 million downloads in the first 2 weeks.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 2003 Apple began selling downloadable copies of major record company songs in MP3 format over the Internet.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIn 2003, Apple's iTunes Store was introduced.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThe first European Apple retail store opened in London in November 2004.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nIt wasn’t long before the iMac G4 was completely disconnected and the replaced with the iMac G5 in the early summer of 2004.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nThat in 2005 Apple was looking at a clear revenue of $290 million or $3.24 billion in sales.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nTo begin with, Apple’s retail stores were only situated in the U.S but late 2005 saw the opening of an Apple retail store in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nSince 2005 Apple has seen a significant increase in not only its stock price but its profits.\n\n![](https://static.zippia.com/ui-router/images/timeline-arrow-down.svg)\n\nOn January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU.

Wayne drops out after a few weeks because he doesn’t want to take the risk as a family man.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1976_2_apple_I_museum-640x373-1.png \"1976_2_apple_I_museum-640×373\")\n\nIn May 1976 “Woz” presents the Apple I at the meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club. The computer costs later $666.66. Paul Terell, head of the chain Byte Shop places 50 orders alone. In total, about 200 devices are sold.\n\n## 1977\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/apple2-med-res.jpg \"apple2\")\n\nIn April 1977, Apple launches the Apple II. The Apple II series was an open system, which means that all essential construction details were published. This construction principle was later copied by IBM and marketed as the IBM PC. The Apple II became the first microcomputer to be widely distributed. It cost $1,295 at launch.\n\n## 1978\n\nJef Raskin (34) starts at Apple Computer. Raskin was Apple Computer’s thirty-first employee, its manager of publications, and manager of the Macintosh project from 1979 to 1982.\n\n## 1979\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/raskin_jobs640-150x150-1.jpg \"raskin_jobs640-150×150\")\n\nA research project for a new low-cost computer is started under the direction of Jef Raskin. This would later become the Macintosh project. Raskin leaves Apple in 1982, even before the Mac was launched, because he would not accept Steve Jobs’ meddling.  \n  \nIn June 1979, the Apple II+ is launched for $1,195.  \n  \nIn July 1979, the project for the Apple Lisa is started. The computer was supposed to be ready in March 1981. In fact, it took until January 1983.\n\nSteve Jobs and his team at Apple visit the legendary research institute Xerox PARC, where they see several novel technologies. These include the Xerox Alto, the first personal computer with a graphical user interface, the computer mouse, and object-oriented programming.\n\n## 1980\n\nSpecifications for the Apple Lisa are developed. It includes several features that Apple employees have seen at Xerox PARC.  \n  \nOn December 12, 1980, Apple goes public, floating 4.6 million shares of stock at $22 per share. The Apple IPO makes some rich, others mad.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/welcome-ibm-786x1024.png \"ibm_PC\")\n\n## 1981\n\nSteve Jobs takes over the Macintosh project.  \n  \nIBM introduces its PC. Apple “welcomes” IBM to the PC market in an ad.\n\nSteve Wozniak crashes a private plane and partially retires from Apple.\n\n## 1982\n\nJef Raskin quits after being pushed out of the Macintosh project by Steve Jobs.\n\n## 1983\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Apple-Lisa-1983-1024x672.jpg \"apple_lisa-440×329-150×150\")\n\nThe Apple Lisa hits the market on January 22, 1983 for $9,995. As sales falter, the price drops to $6,995 by the end of the year.  \n  \nAt Apple, the previously competing Lisa and Mac divisions are merged.  \n  \nIn April, Steve Jobs convinced Pepsico president John Sculley to join Apple. “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to take a chance and change the world?” was Jobs’ legendary question, which ultimately won Sculley over as Apple CEO.\n\nIn order to qualify for the Cannes Advertising Film Festival, Apple had the famous Big Brother commercial for the Mac in December 1983 on TV station KMVT in Twin Apple Lisa (1983) Falls (Idaho). On January 22, 1984, six weeks later, the commercial then aired during a commercial break in SuperBowl XVIII. The ad not only cleared Cannes, but was repeatedly aired by TV stations in the news. The Chiat/Day agency calculated that the “1984” spot generated over five million dollars worth of free publicity.\n\n## 1984\n\nJanuary 24, 1984: The Mac is launched for $2,495. The Apple Lisa 2 retails for $3,495.  \n  \nApple launches the “Test a Mac” promotional program. Prospective customers can take a Mac home from a retailer for 24 hours to try it out, free of charge. Although the promotion was unique and innovative up to that point, the program does not show the desired success. For one thing, too few Macs are initially available. And many customers do not bring the computers back to the stores in perfect condition, incurring significant repair costs.  \n  \nApril 24, 1984: The Apple IIc is introduced. With the different Apple II series, Apple does the main part of its business.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/retouchphoto_apple_macintosh_1984_high_res_clean-640x426-1.jpg \"retouchphoto_apple_macintosh_1984_high_res_clean-640×426\")\n\n## 1985\n\nSales of the Mac falter because too few applications are available. After a power struggle with then Apple CEO John Sculley, Steve Jobs is relieved of his operational duties. Jobs leaves Apple and founds the computer company NeXT Inc. and uses the proceeds from stock sales to buy Lucas Film’s animation division, creating Pixar.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steve_jobs_oct_2011.jpg \"steve_jobs_oct_2011\")\n\n“AS YOU KNOW, THE COMPANY’S RECENT REORGANIZATION LEFT ME WITH NO WORK TO DO AND NO ACCESS EVEN TO REGULAR MANAGEMENT REPORTS. I AM BUT 30 AND WANT STILL TO CONTRIBUTE AND ACHIEVE.“\n\n#### — Steven P. Jobs in a [letter](https://www.mac-history.net/steve-jobs/2009-09-07/i-am-but-30-and-want-still-to-contribute-and-achieve-steve-jobss-resignation-letter-1985) to Mike Markkula\n\nThe Apple Lisa is discontinued. Some models are converted and sold as the Mac XL.  \n  \nMicrosoft licenses some of the Mac technologies to develop its Office package for the Mac. At the end of 1985 Microsoft publishes its first Windows version 1.01.\n\n## 1987\n\nApple builds the Mac II, the first Mac that does not rely on an all-in-one design. The Mac II can also support color displays. At the same time, Apple launches the Mac SE with the classic all-in-one design. Both machines allow expansion slots to be added to Macs for the first time.  \n  \nThe installed base of Mac users grows to 1 million users.  \n  \nRoss Perot invests $20 million in NeXT, Inc.  \n  \nIn August 1987, Microsoft releases its first version of Windows, but it is virtually unusable.\n\n## 1988\n\nThe greatly improved Windows 2.03 is released.  \n  \nApple sues Microsoft over various similarities between Windows and Mac OS. Microsoft counters the counterclaim and refers to the license agreement from the year 1985. A protracted legal battle ensues, with Apple unable to stop the further development of Windows. Apple is unable to stop the further development of Windows.  \n  \nMicrosoft prevails in court in 1992 and also wins the appeal two years later. In 1995, the US Supreme Court confirms the rejection of the appeal.\n\n## 1989\n\nXerox sues Apple over the user interface of the Mac and the Apple Lisa. The suit is dismissed a year later.  \n  \nApple Computer is also sued by Apple Corps Ltd, the Beatles’ record label, for trademark infringement. In 2006, the Beatles initially lose. In 2010, the adversaries come to an agreement. The agreement stipulates that in the future, California-based Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer Inc.) will own all rights to the “Apple” trademark and the apple logo and will license some usage rights from the Beatles’ record company Apple Corps Ltd. in return.  \n  \nApple disposes of unsold models of the Lisa in a landfill in Logan, Utah.  \n  \nApple introduces the Macintosh Portable. The device weighs about seven kilograms and was initially shipped without a backlight on the screen. As a result, the Portable barely lived up to its name and did not sell well.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/macintosh_portable.jpg \"macintosh_portable\")\n\n## 1990\n\nSteve Jobs launches the NeXTstation for 4,995, a year after introducing the NeXTstep OS operating system\n\n## 1991\n\nApple draws conclusions from the portable debacle and launches the much lighter and more compact PowerBook 100, the first true Mac notebook.\n\n## 1992\n\nApple sets new standards with the subnote family PowerBook Duo. A docking station ensures that several interfaces do not have to be present in the PowerBook Duo itself in order to save weight and space.  \n  \nApple and Novell launch the “Star Trek” project, which aims to get the Macintosh operating system running on Intel hardware. A first proof of concept is created. However, the project is abandoned in 1993.  \n  \nMicrosoft launches Windows 3.1 and increasingly competes with Apple.\n\n## 1993\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/michael_spindler-150x150-1.jpeg \"michael_spindler-150×150\")\n\nApple delivers the first Power Macintosh models. These computers no longer contain a 680×0 processor from Motorola, but the more modern PowerPC chips produced by Motorola and IBM.  \n  \nApple launches the Apple Newton PDA at the Macworld Expo in Boston in August 1983. The futuristic device proves to be little success in business because important features such as handwriting recognition work only moderately. The Newton flop also undermined Apple CEO John Sculley’s position of power.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/doonesbury-apple-newton-egg-freckles-lr-e1490303217696-2-6.jpeg \"doonesbury-apple-newton-egg-freckles-lr-e1490303217696-2-6\")\n\nMichael Spindler, who is called “The Diesel” at Apple, replaces Sculley as Apple’s chief executive. Sculley remains chairman for now.\n\n## 1994\n\nThe first “DOS-compatible” Mac, the Quadra 610, is introduced. It contains a second motherboard and other components to run DOS and early Windows versions in parallel to the Mac OS. This is followed by a handful of Macs that are also “DOS compatible”.  \n  \nApple licenses its operating system Mac OS to selected Mac clone manufacturers like Power Computing or Umax, with Apple retaining control over key components of the hardware design used by the licensees.  \n  \nCode-named “Copland”, this is Apple’s first attempt to replace its aging operating system.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/apple_copland-640x480-1.gif \"apple_copland-640×480\")\n\nIn the operating system version, Mac OS 7.5 Apple introduces the tools Mac Easy Open and PC Exchange. They allow the exchange of floppy disks and files with PCs running DOS or Windows.\n\n## 1995\n\nPower Computing ships the first Mac clones: Power, PowerWave and PowerCurve.  \n  \nAugust 24th, 1995: Microsoft launches Windows 95 with a huge publicity show.\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mac_home_w95.gif \"mac_home_w95\")\n\n## 1996\n\nThe PowerBook 1400 becomes the first Mac notebook to ship with an internal optical drive.  \n  \nApple freezes development of Copland and begins searching for companies that can provide a technological foundation for the next generation of an operating system. The company Be Inc., which had been founded by former Apple manager Jean-Louis Gassée, is shortlisted. The company had developed the BeOS.  \n  \nApple CEO Michael Spindler is replaced by Gil Amelio.\n\n## 1997\n\nApple introduces the Power Mac G3. It is the first Mac with the PowerPC G3 processor.  \n  \nTo mark the twentieth anniversary of Apple’s founding, the Twentieth Anniversary Mac is released. In an all-in-one design, Apple installs an LCD flat-panel display for desktop Macs for the first time. The anniversary Mac costs a whopping $7,500. For that, customers get a setup through a concierge service. Later, the price of the “Spartacus” drops significantly.  \n  \nApple surprisingly decides against BeOS and takes over NeXT in order to use the NeXT operating system OpenStep as a basis for its own new operating system. This deal also brings Steve Jobs back to Apple, initially as a consultant.\n\nApple announces Rhapsody, the code name for the new Mac OS based on NeXT OpenStep, for developers.  \n  \nApple releases Mac OS 8, the name it originally intended to use for the Copland system. Since the clone license agreements are tied to Mac OS 7.x, this move marks the beginning of the end of the Mac clone era.  \n  \nGil Amelio resigns as Apple CEO and makes room for Steve Jobs at the top of the company.\n\n## 1998\n\nSteve Jobs transforms Apple’s offerings, saying goodbye to products like the Apple Newton and introducing the iMac as the cornerstone of Apple’s product line. It is the first Mac with a USB and SCSI port. Umax discontinues the last Mac clone, the SuperMac.\n\n## 1999\n\n![](https://www.mac-history.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/imac-480x344-1.jpeg \"imac-480×344\")\n\nThe Power Mac G3 Blue & White is introduced. The clever tower design with an easy-open latch, the Mac as easy as upgrade or repair.  \n  \nThe first iBook picks up the colorful design of the iMac and is designed to strengthen Apple’s position in the market.  \n  \nThe first iMac (1997) in the education market again.\n\nThe Macintosh hardware comes with a multimedia software package: iMovie was first introduced in October 1999, which made it convenient to edit home videos. Later came iDVD for semi-professional DVD productions. With iPhoto, Garage Band and iWeb, the iLife package was then put together: The Mac thus evolved into the “hub” of the digital life.\n\nRead more: Timeline (part II) – [The history of Apple (2000 – 2009)](https://www.mac-history.net/2022/12/16/timeline-the-history-of-apple-2000-2009/)\n\n![Christoph](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f2eb1b928cb5f044e7d88c56a7783b211545fda6c66f6e635b146b2ddc47e56?s=117&d=mm&r=g)\n\n### [Timeline – The history of Apple (2000 – 2009)](https://www.mac-history.net/2022/12/16/timeline-the-history-of-apple-2000-2009/ \"Timeline – The history of Apple (2000 – 2009)\")\n\n### [Timeline – The history of Apple (2010 – 2020)](https://www.mac-history.net/2022/12/15/timeline-the-history-of-apple-2010-2020/ \"Timeline – The history of Apple (2010 – 2020)\")\n\n#### 4 COMMENTS\n\n![Leo](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec2fa06e611d58db578548ae3897c936133d97fd925acfa0795105065335f2b9?s=50&d=mm&r=g)\n\nSteve jobs is dead in 2011 not in 2001 like you said in intro\n\n![Cannacapable](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3db71463f0c8f9cedfd40496b98db92385d8040ac1a4270fd85d307af5ee0691?s=50&d=mm&r=g)\n\nI still remember when Steve Jobs launched the NeXTstation\n\n![The Apple Macintosh - Sera Topics](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=50&d=mm&r=g)\n\n[…] Apple website history section: [Click] […]\n\n![Scribd Downloader](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2e70c23377d896dd2bcc59265d9c57cdb540b9c105f1116ea7ec0b5873556e67?s=50&d=mm&r=g)\n\nWhat an incredible journey!

Apple’s innovations, from the iPhone to the personal computer to the tablet, have repeatedly made history. Its focus on design, user-friendliness, and innovation has left an enduring mark on the tech landscape. Its massive market capitalization makes it one of the world’s most valuable and profitable companies.\n\nThe combination of sleek, minimalist design and intuitive interfaces is instantly recognizable as the Apple brand. The evolution of this renowned global company can be traced through six defining products.\n\n• _Apple I (1976)_\n\n![Image 4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:524/1*bER6icUIqC3uaODhSLcbig.jpeg)\n\nPhoto Credits: Pinterest\n\nThe [Apple-1](https://applescoop.org/story/what-is-the-apple-1-the-history-of-apples-first-ever-product) debuted at the iconic Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California, in July 1976, going on sale that month for US$666.66. This computer offered an affordable solution – the built-in terminal circuitry eliminated the need for expensive monitors, requiring just a keyboard and a television set. It featured a 1 MHz 8-bit MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, 4 kilobytes of RAM, and 1 kilobyte of Graphic memory – impressive for the time. It came equipped with Apple Integer BASIC, a programming language that opened up new possibilities for users with its flexibility, performance, and user-friendliness.\n\n• _Apple Macintosh (1984)_\n\n![Image 5](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*TVpmpzJdg05azR6J-sYspA.jpeg)\n\nPhoto Credits: OpenCulture\n\nThe original 1984 Macintosh featured a small, monochrome monitor, rudimentary graphics, and a robotic synthesized voice. The groundbreaking GUI and design-focused features made it a favorite among creatives in fields like design and architecture. Another version, the Macintosh 128k, is equipped with an integrated handle that simplifies moving and carrying the computer. The Apple Macintosh 128K’s 9-inch (22.9 cm) display offers a resolution of 512 x 342 pixels, housed within a 13.6-inch (34.5 cm) tall case.\n\n• _iMac G3 (1998)_\n\n![Image 6](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*GbR2lzGmJJdlBYTYajJCfg.jpeg)\n\nPhoto Credits: Pinterest\n\nThe iMac G3 was a user-friendly and successful computer for education and web exploration. Its design showcased vibrant colors within a see-through plastic shell. It provided ample storage (up to 128 GB), two USB ports, and versatile audio connections for headphones and input. The diverse color palette, with over ten options, allowed users to personalize their computers.\n\n• _iPod (2001)_\n\n![Image 7](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*fUlZ1CXsvTFW6uJMyj1Uyw.jpeg)\n\nPhoto Credits: Pinterest\n\nThe first iPod laid the foundation for the timeless design of the iPod Classic. The iPod’s intuitive controls, playlists, easy iTunes syncing, and access to the iTunes Music Store drove its massive popularity. With its vast 5GB storage, it could hold around 1,000 songs, far exceeding the capacity of other MP3 players. These [iPods](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2022/05/the-music-lives-on/) had a rectangular shape, a square screen, an intuitive scroll wheel, and a center button for easy navigation.\n\n• _iPhone (2007)_\n\n![Image 8](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*D-TCha_Hv6CeXO4nE0cSkg.jpeg)\n\nPhoto Credits: MacWorld\n\nThe phone’s 3.50-inch display has a 320x480 pixel resolution, suitable for basic web browsing, calls, and messaging. The Apple iPhone featured a 412 MHz single-core processor and 128MB of RAM, reflecting the technological standards of its time. The phone has motion detection, light adjustment, altitude measurement, orientation tracking, proximity sensing, and navigation sensors. The iPhone 3G significantly improved on its predecessor with faster 3G connectivity, built-in GPS, more storage options, and a lower price point.\n\n• _iPad (2010)_\n\n![Image 9](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*sDKNZxSPYxGm2EdVRlbE_Q.jpeg)\n\nPhoto Credits: AppleInsider\n\nImagine a giant iPod touch or a super-sized iPhone designed for entertainment and web browsing, not phone calls. For maximum screen usage, look for iPad-specific apps, but you can still use iPhone apps on your iPad with the zoom option. The iPad’s star feature is its stunning 9.7-inch LED-backlit IPS display – Apple delivers an exceptional viewing experience. While the bezel might appear wide, it serves a practical purpose: preventing the responsive 1024 x 768 capacitive, multitouch LED-backlit display from registering accidental touches.\n\nOne of the biggest draws of Apple products is their integration. It enables features like making phone calls from your Mac, using your iPhone as a webcam for your Mac, and instantly tethering your iPhone’s internet to your Mac. Moving between Apple devices feels natural and reduces friction compared to using devices from different manufacturers.

The company unveiled the Apple II in 1977, essentially creating a mass market for personal computers. Apple went public in 1981.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2013-10-09_at_4.28.14_PM.png]()\n![Screen_Shot_2013-10-09_at_4.28.14_PM.png](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/553f1293407482e8fe9514856d33d1988badb84c/hub/2013/10/09/ade4c477-8533-11e3-bc97-14feb5ca9861/Screen_Shot_2013-10-09_at_4.28.14_PM.png?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​January 1984 - Macintosh computer\n\nApple grabbed the world's attention with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh. The company unveiled the new machine at an event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, not long after airing a Super Bowl ad directed by Ridley Scott. The Mac wasn't the first computer with a \"graphical user interface\" that relied on icons rather than command lines. That honor belonged to the Xerox Star. Even so, the Mac influenced the personal computing industry and prompted more intuitive software.\n\n![imgdjakdjask9706.jpg]()\n![imgdjakdjask9706.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/acb858567940be6f218d208a81aa40f413fe3fe6/hub/2016/03/30/7985085f-348e-4c0a-9786-bcf069af5b96/imgdjakdjask9706.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​1985 - Steve Jobs is ousted\n\nApple ousted Steve Jobs in 1985, marking one of the most dramatic moments in tech history. It was also a key milestone in Jobs' career. Jobs co-founded NeXT Computer that year. In 1986, he bought animation studio Pixar from Lucasfilm for $5 million. Apple bought NeXT in 1996 for more than $400 million, while Disney paid more than $7 billion to buy Pixar in 2006.\n\n![wwdc-iphone-gallery-1.jpg]()\n![wwdc-iphone-gallery-1.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/32d2a9fae98766c249f8416994bd28bbc80f8d65/hub/2016/03/30/f7f6342a-4f22-4d5c-8624-bef9e9d8a74b/wwdc-iphone-gallery-1.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## July 1997 - Steve Jobs returns as CEO\n\nShortly after Apple bought NeXT acquisition, Steve Jobs forced then-CEO Gil Amelio out. That made Jobs the de facto CEO of Apple in 1997. He joked he was iCEO -- interim, get it? -- but wasted no time rebuilding a company that was on the verge of bankruptcy. He convinced Microsoft to invest $150 million and support Office for the Mac for the next five years, even as he jettisoned many Apple's products. Among those cut: the cult-favorite Newton personal assistant.\n\n![iMac_original_Steve_Jobs_CNET.jpg]()\n![iMac_original_Steve_Jobs_CNET.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/8eefd7ef25eb1444b58d6a19ebbdf3260e7ae401/hub/2009/01/21/27f9a977-84a0-11e3-beb9-14feb5ca9861/iMac_original_Steve_Jobs_CNET.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## August 1998 - iMac\n\nSteve Jobs rejuvenated Apple with the first iMac. Its colorful, translucent design stunned the tech industry, prompting other computer makers to move away from their standard gray boxes. The iMac was also famous for what it didn't have: A floppy disk drive. Jobs decided the world would move to CDs and Internet downloads and away from disks. It was a controversial move, but he was right.\n\n![dwf15-365279.jpg]()\n![dwf15-365279.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/43ff4f7d976d3dc8ad3a47b68065ba8b8054c4d4/hub/2016/03/30/d75a2032-c17d-4504-a037-691d6156dea4/dwf15-365279.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​January & October 2001 - iTunes and iPod\n\nThe iPod wasn't the first digital music player, but it quickly became the most popular. Launched in 2001, the iPod became the primary driver of Apple's renaissance. Analysts called it a \"halo\" product that drew people into Apple's stores, where they sometimes bought other products too.\n\nApple's iTunes software, which offered people an easy way to manage lots of music, contributed to the iPod's success. Apple released the software for Microsoft Windows in 2003, the same year Apple launched the iTunes Store, selling songs for 99 cents apiece and creating the online music market.\n\n![42-16245066.jpg]()\n![42-16245066.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/2eedb48d406e8248c144571011ac1f5aeb8c3329/hub/2016/03/30/ad060c8b-6e81-4cdc-8d09-8561b63bdffe/42-16245066.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## March 2001 - OS X\n\nApple's OS X was a marriage of NeXT's software and Apple's designs. The technology built in OS X was later used in the software that powered the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple Watch.\n\n![40154554-3-iphone4stevejobspic2610.jpg]()\n![40154554-3-iphone4stevejobspic2610.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/0f4109c4339c765578016ec3d578af5cf294debd/hub/2016/03/30/79e40bd5-bdff-4e53-b647-6d1ebb6630f7/40154554-3-iphone4stevejobspic2610.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​January 2007 - iPhone\n\nSteve Jobs showed off Apple's first iPhone during a keynote presentation at the 2007 Macworld Expo in San Francisco. He said Apple would \"reinvent the phone.\" He was right. The device went on sale in the US on June 29. Since then, Apple has sold more than 2 billion iPhones, making it one of the largest phone makers in the world. The day the iPhone was announced, the company also changed its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc.\n\n![Apple_TV.jpg]()\n![Apple_TV.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/f5b9af3a800f4f0c95bd432dcdabffe64e26f715/hub/2009/03/05/0b49a892-fdba-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/Apple_TV.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​January 2007 - Apple TV\n\nOriginally announced in 2006, the Apple TV launch was easily overshadowed by the company's iPhone announcement. It didn't help that Apple kept calling it \"a hobby,\" an effort to keep us from wondering whether the company was betting Apple TV could be as large as the iPhone. Of course, it isn't. Still, the device has helped inspire Apple's push into entertainment, and its namesake is part of Apple's services push.\n\n![img2493.jpg]()\n![img2493.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/70efa50ce32cc205eea672f1e3e70403ff9a5a30/hub/2016/03/31/83f44034-4ca4-4c47-859d-d2bcd6e0386f/apple-steve-jobs-ipad-2010-2471.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​April 2010 - iPad\n\nApple followed up with the iPad in 2010, finally giving the tablet market the jolt it needed to go mainstream. The iPad inspired Apple to make thinner laptops, which in turn pushed the tech industry to do the same. During a 2010 interview, Steve Jobs said Apple had begun working on the iPad before the iPhone, but realized a phone needed the touchscreen software first.\n\n![apple-event-sept9-2015-tim-cook-ipad-pro-2622.jpg]()\n![apple-event-sept9-2015-tim-cook-ipad-pro-2622.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/8c4bfc2eafc4523e4c6554fbca3b9534987d9f9c/hub/2015/09/10/916fc682-3751-4c38-9128-0b21c2745e55/apple-event-sept9-2015-tim-cook-ipad-pro-2622.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​August 2011 - Tim Cook becomes CEO\n\nAfter three medical leaves, a surgery and a liver transplant, Steve Jobs stepped down as Apple's CEO, naming Tim Cook in his place. Jobs remained the company's chairman until his death about two months later. He was 56.\n\n![apple-watch-instagram-6796.jpg]()\n![apple-watch-instagram-6796.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/76821d6cbaf68e833d1bdfa153691d010268fdb0/hub/2015/03/10/568b3ee1-4724-429e-ac07-9a9392bafcff/apple-watch-instagram-6796.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​September 2014 - iPhone 6 and Apple Watch\n\nThe Apple Watch, unveiled at an event in September 2014, was the first new product line released after Steve Jobs' death. It went on sale in April 2015. Apple hasn't released sales data, and the tech community can't decide whether it's a success or a failure.\n\n![090716-apple-airpods-music-7021.jpg]()\n![090716-apple-airpods-music-7021.jpg](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/bebe77f7d9739ee730bd5b81f726e6bd20df89fe/hub/2016/09/07/1b956535-428a-46b6-b328-c4b9fd1f5958/090716-apple-airpods-music-7021.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​September 2016 - Apple's AirPods offer a new type of wireless headphone\n\nWhen they were first introduced, Apple's AirPods were ridiculed for their bulky design. But the $150 device, which Apple promised was easier to pair and use with your devices because of special wireless chips the company developed, [have become a hit](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-true-wireless-hearables-market-reaches-12-5-million-units-q4-2018/).\n\n![original-qualityraw-310-apple-iphone-event-cupertino-cnet-12-09-17]()\n![original-qualityraw-310-apple-iphone-event-cupertino-cnet-12-09-17](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/c559402055761fe87120600492b173380eaddf29/hub/2017/09/12/0e82b1c7-e89e-4501-8703-bccc20d83d79/original-qualityraw-310-apple-iphone-event-cupertino-cnet-12-09-17.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## ​September 2017 - The iPhone X changes things up\n\nFor a decade, the front of Apple's iPhones looked pretty much the same, with large bezels on the top and bottom that were used for a home button, fingerprint reader or selfie cam. The iPhone X did away with that style, removing the home button and expanding the selfie cam, which now has sensors for identifying users with Face ID. Apple called it \"the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.\" It was also Apple's first new iPhone to cost $999, instead of the typical $650. Despite the high price, Apple said it quickly became a best-seller.\n\n![009-apple-iphone-xs-xs-max-and-apple-watch-series-4-go-on-sale-at-nyc-flagship-store]()\n![009-apple-iphone-xs-xs-max-and-apple-watch-series-4-go-on-sale-at-nyc-flagship-store](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/5307287411e889598c2ea27eab523aaf8745f103/hub/2018/09/21/1e924a2c-d92b-452d-b333-e8d0119ffbb2/009-apple-iphone-xs-xs-max-and-apple-watch-series-4-go-on-sale-at-nyc-flagship-store.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## August 2018 - Apple becomes the highest-valued company, ever\n\nTo Apple faithful, the company was already of high value. In the summer of 2018, the stock market made offered its opinion when it pushed the company's market capitalization to more than a trillion dollars, the first time that level had been reached by a US company. In a memo sent to Apple employees, CEO Tim Cook called the valuation a \"significant milestone\" but added that it wasn't the \"most important measure\" of the company's success.\n\n![apple-tv-plus-tim-cook]()\n![apple-tv-plus-tim-cook](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/4fb8702bc8dbbe0f89221fbea27cbdbb9a11e501/hub/2019/03/25/9a896212-c9d7-4d32-9b35-6c489aeddf85/apple-tv-plus-tim-cook.png?auto=webp&width=1200)\n\n## March 2019 - Apple switches to services\n\nAfter more than four decades making money primarily by selling gadgets, Apple said it intended to expand efforts in monthly subscriptions. The company unveiled Apple TV Plus, [a streaming service](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-card-apple-tv-plus-apple-arcade-its-just-another-way-to-say-iphone/) for original shows funded by Apple, Apple News Plus, a news service with access to about 300 publications, and Apple Arcade, [a video game service](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-arcade-wants-to-become-the-xbox-and-playstation-of-mobile-gaming/).\n\n## March 2019 - Apple has a credit card now\n\nApple also said it was [creating a credit card](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-cards-underwhelming-features-wont-spark-google-samsung-copycats/) in partnership with Goldman Sachs and MasterCard.

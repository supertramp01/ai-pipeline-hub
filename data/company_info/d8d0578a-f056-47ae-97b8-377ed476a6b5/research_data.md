We offer a suite of capabilities that give intelligent agents the power to interact with digital environments as humans do. Emergence has developed advanced techniques for distilling web-page Document Object Models (DOMs) and reasoning through them with an LLM. Agents with these abilities can then autonomously manipulate a browser or desktop based on natural language instruction given via chat or our robust voice-control models.

[...] Our advanced multimodal chat system integrates enterprise-specific information and media into conversations via retrieved-augmented generation (RAG). The system uses an LLM fine-tuned for question-answering which is highly adept at preventing AI hallucinations, trained to indicate a lack of information before making an incorrect guess. These advanced capabilities allow for AI-powered chat fit to answer sophisticated questions on a large scale. [...] Image 1

**Content:**

Emergence AI announced a major update for May 2025 that includes:

   Containerized deployment so the orchestrator can run in any cloud environment
   Enhanced self-play capabilities for faster agent improvement
   Better integration with existing AI frameworks

The company's team includes researchers from IBM Research, Google Brain, Allen Institute for AI, Amazon, and Meta. They know what they're doing. [...] You know what's wild? We just crossed a line that nobody's talking about enough.

While everyone's busy arguing about ChatGPT's latest update, a company called Emergence AI just launched something that makes those conversations feel small. They built an AI that builds other AIs. In real time. No coding required. [...] I've seen a lot of AI agent platforms. LangChain, Microsoft's AutoGen, CrewAI - they're all trying to solve similar problems.

But they're all focused on orchestration. They help you connect existing agents and run them in sequence.

Emergence AI is doing something completely different. As their CEO puts it: "They orchestrate, Emergence creates."

**Content:**

Emergence AI's team has never shied away from bold ambitions, but after years of R&D, they just vaulted into territory typically reserved for science fiction. Emergence AI has introduced an advanced orchestration platform that challenges the status quo of what artificial intelligence can do. Rather than another incremental feature set, Emergence's flagship product represents a push toward self-improving AI: _agents that build and refine other agents._ [...] How did we get here? For years, the talk around AI's potential to evolve itself has mostly been confined to white papers and futuristic musings. A key missing piece of the puzzle—the ability for AI agents to autonomously design other AI agents and multi-agent systems. Now, Emergence's orchestrator is demonstrating exactly this. It's not merely an AI assisting humans; it's an AI building agents to solve tasks, spinning up specialized variants, and, crucially, self-improving in the process. [...] _"Recursive intelligence paves the path for agents to create agents, and it does not stop there,"_ says Satya Nitta, Emergence's Co-founder and CEO. These words are more than a tagline; they're a roadmap. The orchestration platform, a meta-agent of sorts, identifies any gap in its agent registry and proceeds to create a new agent or multi-agent from scratch—setting objectives, evaluating progress, iterating until it hits its goal, and then saving that creation for future use.

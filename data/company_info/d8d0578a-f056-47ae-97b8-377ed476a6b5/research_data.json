When you’re chatting with today’s GenAI tools, it feels like you’re hitting an LLM — but under the hood, you’re engaging with an agentic system: planners, verifiers, tools, and models working in concert to solve real tasks. On SiliconANGLE & theCUBE ’s #NextFrontiersofAI podcast, hosted by Scott Hebner , our CEO and co-founder Satya Nitta breaks down why Emergence AI builds agentic systems — and why that matters for enterprise outcomes. 🎧 Listen to the full episode, ‘Agentic AI – What’s Hype, Myth, and Truth’: https://brnw.ch/21wU5hC [Likes: 12, Comments: 0]; **N/A** (N/A): N/A [Likes: 0, Comments: 0]; **Satya Nitta** (1d Edited 1d): One of the coolest parts about building Emergence AI is the insane quality of talent that is attracted to the work of defining the agentic frontier. Whether we are redefining how to build intelligent systems with SOTA long term memory or rethinking marketing, there is no shortage of incredible talent willing to lead the charge. One such example is Aniketh Arvind , easily one of the most brilliant young technologists I have had the privilege of meeting. He is a ECE sophomore at Princeton University , an intern at emergence (but so much more than that - a special advisor and ambassador really), an advisor to a generation of young talent, all while working on his own startup! In addition to being a brilliant young technologist and entrepreneur, he is also a marketing whiz in the making! He jumped on the challenge of rethinking our approach to marketing and is helping us build it in a very non-traditional way. We can't reimagine the future with great tech alone - we have to reimagine every aspect of how to build the company and reach the market and Aniketh is helping us realize this in ways I never imagined!

That flow breaks under scale, domain complexity, and tool sprawl. With CRAFT, agents can: ✔️ Ingest data from a variety of sources ✔️ Detect and fix drift—no glue code ✔️ Run statistical analysis, generate visualizations ✔️ Auto-trigger reports or downstream actions Just from a prompt. Under the hood: - Agents are built from natural language - They remember context across sessions - They assemble workflows across APIs, UIs, and systems - They self-tune with feedback - And they run with deterministic execution for full auditability It’s the foundation of the Agentic Enterprise—and CRAFT is the first enterprise-native platform built to deliver it. Comment “CRAFT” for early access! #BuiltWithCRAFT [Likes: 22, Comments: 2]; **Emergence AI** (4d Edited): Thank you to Jaymes Davis (Chief Technical Evangelist at Kasm Technologies ) and Tabish Sangrar (Founder & CEO at Encore Health ) for sharing their takeaways from our recent San Francisco IRL. We’re committed to listening and learning as we continue the conversation around the agentic frontier. Next up: we’re hosting this month’s New York AI User Group at our NYC office overlooking Bryant Park. Join us as we dive into what it actually takes to move AI from promising prototype to production-grade deployment — and how to build the teams to make that leap stick.

[Likes: 23, Comments: 1]; **The AI Furnace 🧨** (1w): Highlights from the AI Hot 100 Summit 🎥 With everyone talking about agents, where do visionary founders and builders see the real value being delivered now and in the future? 🧐 Our very own Hamza Zaveri discussed this and more with some of the most prolific founders in AI today: 👉 Ravi Kokku (Co-Founder & CTO, Emergence AI , raised $100M) 👉 Surojit Chatterjee (Founder & CEO, Ema Unlimited , fmr CPO Coinbase) 👉 Emma Burrows (Co-Founder & CTO, Portia AI , fmr CTO Stripe UK) They talked about the real world applications they are servicing cross-industries and some of the pains and gains of implementing AI into production. Power packed session! The AI Furnace 🧨 #AI #Agents #Enterprise #FutureOfWork #AIInnovation [Likes: 37, Comments: 0]; **Aadit Sheth** (1w Edited): Dashboards show you data. These Al agents understand it. 5 minutes = strategic action. This isn’t a static report. It’s a hands-on demo of how to talk to your data... and get back instant answers. In this video, you’ll watch: → A plain English question → AI agents write the code → Visual insights + decisions in minutes No SQL. No dashboards. No waiting. Just results. If you work with data, this will blow your mind.

This will inevitably beget far-reaching societal impact, no small part of which is likely to be the fundamental rethinking of interaction between humans and machines.\n\nAt the heart of this advance is the transformer architecture and the resulting large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) built with it. While language understanding in machines has matured, their ability to plan and reason, as well as sense and understand the world needs to continue evolving to a point where machines can be truly transformative to the human endeavor. Fortunately, an emerging class of systems, called AI agents, based on LLMs and LVMs are beginning to show promise here. At Emergence AI, our mission is to advance this frontier of AI and build systems that reach a level of intelligence that truly unlocks the potential of AI to be beneficial to humanity.\n\n‍\n\n**LLM-Based Agents:**\n---------------------\n\nIn venturing to understand why the new class of LLM-based AI agents is so promising, it might be illustrative to first define what they are.\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66de0985d14d58299084e1f1/674f9a4c21d8b5f0f3ca6eca_664e13be28dca3b99418d011_Diagram%25202.png)\n\n_Agents (their anatomy pictured above) are building blocks which can communicate with each other and with humans in natural language, can control tools, and can perform actions in the digital or physical world._\n\nAgents have some functional capacity to plan, reason, and remember. They are the building blocks upon which scalable, intelligent systems can be built. Such systems, comprised of one or more agents, can profoundly reshape our ideas of what computers can do for us. These systems can transform many aspects of human interaction with computers, with profound implications for how we use computers, how we interact with them, and what they can do for us. These could range from asking systems of agents in natural language to perform a variety of actions such as book travel, plan vacation or purchase items, to asking systems to process claims and work across various applications on a smartphone or laptop and complete complex tasks for people, all with simple human commands issued in natural language.\n\nThere has been a lot of research in this space over the last couple of decades. However, the advent of LLM- and LVM-based AI agents promises to advance this field rapidly, improving the capabilities of agents in all the aspects mentioned above.\n\nWe believe that in order for agents to be used to build truly intelligent, scalable systems, they must meet a specific benchmark in the characteristics they possess and the ways they organize together ([_ref 1_](https://blog.emergence.ai/2024/03/18/The-anatomy-of-agents.html)).\n\n**The Definition of an Agent**\n\nAn agent has _(_[_ref 1_](https://blog.emergence.ai/2024/03/18/The-anatomy-of-agents.html)_)_:\n\n1) **Autonomy:** it is a self-operating, interactive entity with its own state, behavior, and decision-making capabilities.\n\n2) **Reactivity and Proactivity:** it is both reactive (meaning it can perceive its environment and respond to changes) and proactive (meaning it can take initiative in alignment with its goals).\n\n3) **Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI):** it is characterized by its beliefs (information about the world), desires (goals or objectives), and intentions (plans of action).\n\n4) **Social Ability & Communication:** it has a communication mechanism and can interact with other agents or entities in its environment. This interaction can be highly complex as it may involve negotiation, coordination, and cooperation.\n\n5) **Self-Improvement:** it has an innate desire to maximize its utility and hence self-improve itself on the task that it was created for.\n\n6) **Security:** it protects itself from being compromised or destroyed. It can be trusted to do no harm to other agents nor the environment it is operating in. Agents _in a system_ will adhere to an organizational framework called agent oriented programming (AOP). The comprehensive tenets of this framework can be found here _(_[_ref 2_](https://blog.emergence.ai/2024/03/18/The-anatomy-of-agents.html)_)_.\n\nOur AOP framework is inspired by the pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP, [_ref 1_](https://blog.emergence.ai/2024/03/18/The-anatomy-of-agents.html)) which played a significant role in the development and evolution of several popular programming languages like C++, Java, Python, and more. Just as these languages are the bedrocks of modern software development, we hope that AOP will enable the development of new classes of agents, systems, and agent frameworks.\n\nWe intend to advance the development of autonomous agents as an open-source project so that the community at large can benefit from and contribute to the project. We believe this is the safest and fastest way to advance the field of AI agents.\n\n‍\n\n**Task and Domain Specific LLMs**\n---------------------------------\n\nLLMs and LVMs act as the “brain” of the AI agent. Emergence will power our agents with our own fine-tuned LLMs and LVMs based primarily on open-source pre-trained models such as Mistral and LLaMA-2. The focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models, using them to power agents and other solutions efficiently, safely, and cost-effectively, is another core pillar of Emergence.\n\nOur domain-specific models can be used both by agent-developers and application-makers as they scale their AI solutions. Each model is trained on the data of its specialized domain and will perform a variety of natural language processing tasks such as question-answering based on custom content and data, rubric-based summarization, video and image recommendation, transcript analysis, or assessment generation.\n\n**Voice Computing Platform**\n----------------------------\n\nOur voice computing platform can accelerate the provisioning of voice interfaces for a variety of enterprises for controlling domain-specific tools and for the contextual retrieval of domain specific information. The platform currently powers AI assistants available on both laptops and front-of-the-room panels which controls various tools and technologies and provide a voice-based chat interface to the world of information relevant to the education domain.\n\nHistorically, there have been two main barriers to the emergence of voice as an interface to computing, namely the inability of humans to successfully communicate with computers completely naturally and the inability of computers to perform more than just rudimentary actions. Thanks to the recent advances in AI, these two barriers have recently been removed. Thus, a fascinating offshoot of the advance of AI is that voice as an interface has the potential to finally mature, decades after it was envisioned, and Emergence has the existing building blocks to deliver on this promise.\n\n**Intelligent Systems**\n-----------------------\n\nThe final set of offerings from Emergence is a set of research, development and consulting services that allow end-customers to develop intelligent systems based on a composition of our offered agents and LLMs. Through our team’s decades long experiences in building some of the most widely scaled, enterprise-grade AI systems, we can help integrate into an enterprise’s ecosystem the self-operating solutions to given problems, automating relevant processes with the most apt in-house or third-party tools.\n\n**Coda**\n--------\n\nThere are several themes that we have not highlighted in this brief introductory document. These include our focus on:\n\n1.   memory systems for agents, which are key to systems that learn and improve over time,\n2.   the implications of systems of self-improving agents with well-defined goals, \n3.   our robust definitions of and commitment to safety,\n4.   and our insight into the fascinating parallels between cognitive systems of mind and artificial systems of agents. \n\nWe intend to develop many of these themes more fully, especially through our ongoing and future collaborations with leading academics.\n\nUltimately, Emergence’s mission is to advance AI and create useful, intelligent machines which maximally automate human interactions with computers.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1) [The Anatomy of Agents](https://blog.emergence.ai/2024/03/18/The-anatomy-of-agents.html)\n\n2) [Self Improving Agents](https://blog.emergence.ai/2024/03/19/Self-improving-agents.html)\n\n3) [Building Narrow Self Improving Agents](https://blog.emergence.ai/2024/03/20/Building-narrow-self-improving-agents.html)\n\n### More from the Journal\n\n[![Image 4](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66de0985d14d58299084e1f1/68557e2c76624304f4203451_Turing_6_high.jpg)](https://www.emergence.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-results-in-agentic-memory)\n\n###### June 19, 2025\n\n[#### State of the Art Results in Agentic Memory](https://www.emergence.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-results-in-agentic-memory)\nEager to apply more sophisticated agentic memory to the largest conversational benchmark, LongMemEval, we discuss the benchmark, our approach, our somewhat disappointing state of the art findings, and the need for a more comprehensive benchmark for agentic memory than LongMemEval.\n\n[![Image 5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66de0985d14d58299084e1f1/6854d5bea1b980ad0088782f_Turing_2_high.jpg)](https://www.emergence.ai/blog/emergence-is-the-new-new-state-of-the-art-in-agent-memory)\n\n###### June 18, 2025\n\n[#### SOTA on LongMemEval with RAG](https://www.emergence.ai/blog/emergence-is-the-new-new-state-of-the-art-in-agent-memory)\nLongMemEval is highlighted as the premier benchmark for evaluating long-term memory, surpassing simple tasks with its complex requirements.

We just crossed a line that nobody's talking about enough.\n\nWhile everyone's busy arguing about ChatGPT's latest update, a company called Emergence AI just launched something that makes those conversations feel small. They built an AI that builds other AIs. In real time. No coding required.\n\nI'm not talking about templates or drag-and-drop builders. I'm talking about an AI that looks at your problem, decides what tools need to exist, then creates those tools from scratch and puts them to work.\n\nThis isn't science fiction anymore. It's happening right now.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   Emergence AI's orchestrator creates custom agents on demand using only text prompts\n*   The system uses recursive thinking to build tools based on what's actually needed\n*   Enterprise workflows that used to take weeks now happen automatically\n*   No coding or manual setup required - just describe what you want\n*   The platform gets smarter over time, reusing successful agents and patterns\n\n* * *\n\n### The Problem Everyone's Been Ignoring\n\nHere's the thing that's been driving me crazy about the AI conversation.\n\nEveryone talks about how smart these language models are getting. GPT-4, Claude, Llama - they can write code, solve problems, even have decent conversations. But there's always been this massive gap.\n\nThey can tell you what to do. They can't actually do it.\n\nYou ask GPT to automate your data pipeline, it gives you a script. Great. Now you need a developer to implement it, test it, and maintain it. You're still stuck in the same old cycle of human bottlenecks.\n\nEmergence AI saw this gap and decided to close it completely.\n\nTheir system doesn't just suggest solutions. It builds them, runs them, and improves them without asking for permission.\n\n* * *\n\n### How This AI Orchestrator Actually Works\n\nThe core of [Emergence AI's platform](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eemergence%2Eai%2F&urlhash=TNK3&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) is something they call the orchestrator. Think of it as a project manager that never sleeps and has the ability to create its own team members.\n\nHere's how it breaks down:\n\n### The Registry Check\n\nFirst, the orchestrator looks at your request and checks its internal registry. It's asking: \"Do I already have agents that can handle this?\"\n\nIf yes, it assigns the work. If no, it moves to step two.\n\n### Agent Creation\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. The system doesn't throw up its hands and ask for help. It creates new agents on the spot.\n\nThese aren't generic tools. Each AI agent is built specifically for your task, with its own memory, planning capabilities, and verification systems.\n\n### The Self-Play Loop\n\nOnce an agent is created, it doesn't just complete the task and disappear. It goes through what Emergence AI calls self-play - executing actions, checking results, and getting better through repetition.\n\nThe orchestrator watches everything, learns from outcomes, and files away what works for future use.\n\n### Recursive Intelligence\n\nThis is the part that makes my brain hurt in the best way. The system practices recursive thinking - it can create goals about creating goals.\n\nWhen it encounters a problem it can't solve, it doesn't just build one agent. It might decide it needs three different agents that work together, and then build a fourth agent to coordinate them.\n\nIt's building teams of specialists, then building managers to run those teams.\n\n* * *\n\n### Real Enterprise Applications That Matter\n\nOkay, enough theory. Let's talk about what this actually does for businesses.\n\nEmergence AI isn't focusing on consumer chatbots or homework helpers. They're going after the boring, repetitive stuff that eats up entire engineering teams.\n\n### Data Pipeline Automation\n\nRemember those ETL pipelines that take weeks to set up? The orchestrator can build them automatically. It looks at your data sources, figures out what transformations are needed, and creates the entire pipeline without human intervention.\n\n### Cloud Migrations\n\nMoving data between cloud platforms used to require project managers, architects, and months of planning. Now you can describe what you want moved and where, and watch it happen.\n\n### Dashboard Creation\n\nGot a messy spreadsheet that needs to become a real-time dashboard? The system can parse unstructured data, clean it up, and build visualization tools that actually make sense.\n\n### Large-Scale Text Processing\n\nClassification, summarization, data extraction from documents - tasks that normally require custom scripts and constant babysitting now run themselves.\n\nOne thing that caught my attention: The Emergence AI orchestrator aims to sit above the fray and work well with any application and vendor that the enterprise uses, uniting them all.\n\nThis isn't trying to replace your existing tools. It's trying to make them work together better.\n\n* * *\n\n### What Makes This Different From Everything Else\n\nI've seen a lot of AI agent platforms. LangChain, Microsoft's AutoGen, CrewAI - they're all trying to solve similar problems.\n\nBut they're all focused on orchestration. They help you connect existing agents and run them in sequence.\n\nEmergence AI is doing something completely different. As their CEO puts it: \"They orchestrate, Emergence creates.\"\n\n### No-Code Interface\n\nYou interact with the platform through natural language. No dragging and dropping. No configuration files. You describe what you want, and it handles everything else.\n\n### Learning Over Time\n\nThis is the killer feature. Most systems create new agents for every new task, leading to what they call \"agent sprawl\" - hundreds of narrow tools that don't talk to each other.\n\nThe orchestrator learns patterns. It starts reusing successful agents across different tasks. It gets more efficient, not more bloated.\n\n### Built-in Verification\n\nEvery agent comes with its own quality control. The system doesn't just build tools and hope they work. It tests them, monitors their performance, and flags problems before they hit production.\n\n* * *\n\n### The Safety Rails\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. An AI that builds other AIs without human oversight? That sounds terrifying.\n\nEmergence AI thought about this too. The platform has multiple layers of human control:\n\n### Access Controls\n\nOnly authorized users can request agent creation. You're not going to accidentally unleash an army of rogue AIs because someone in accounting got curious.\n\n### Verification Rubrics\n\nEvery agent gets evaluated against predefined criteria before it goes live. Performance, accuracy, adherence to objectives - it all gets checked.\n\n### Human-in-the-Loop Validation\n\nThe orchestrator pauses at critical checkpoints. It shows you what it built and waits for approval before deploying at scale.\n\nAs CEO Satya Nida put it: \"You need to verify that the multi-agent system or the new agents spawned are doing the task you want and went in the right direction.\"\n\nAutomation with accountability. That's the balance they're trying to strike.\n\n* * *\n\n### What's Coming Next\n\nThe platform is still early, but the roadmap is aggressive.\n\nEmergence AI announced a major update for May 2025 that includes:\n\n*   Containerized deployment so the orchestrator can run in any cloud environment\n*   Enhanced self-play capabilities for faster agent improvement\n*   Better integration with existing AI frameworks\n\nThe company's team includes researchers from IBM Research, Google Brain, Allen Institute for AI, Amazon, and Meta. They know what they're doing.\n\nAccording to [their latest announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance%2Eyahoo%2Ecom%2Fnews%2Femergence-ai-debuts-autonomous-multi-170000885%2Ehtml&urlhash=Mlk1&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), the orchestrator operates at the intersection of AI and distributed systems, which explains why it feels different from other AI tools.\n\n* * *\n\n### What This Means for You\n\nHere's the bottom line: we're moving from asking AI what to do to telling AI what we want done.\n\nThat's a massive shift.\n\nIf you're running a business, this changes your automation strategy completely. Instead of hiring developers to build custom solutions, you describe problems and watch solutions build themselves.\n\nIf you're a developer, this doesn't replace you. But it changes what you focus on. Less time building routine automation, more time solving complex problems that actually need human creativity.\n\nIf you're just trying to get work done, this is the future where technology actually helps instead of creating more complexity.\n\n### The Reality Check\n\nWill every company adopt this immediately? No. Enterprise moves slowly, and people are rightfully cautious about fully autonomous systems.\n\nBut the early adopters are going to have a serious advantage. While their competitors are still managing agent libraries and debugging pipelines, they'll be describing problems and watching them get solved.\n\n* * *\n\n### Why This Changes Everything Long-Term\n\nWe've been talking about AI replacing jobs for years. That conversation always felt abstract because AI could think but couldn't act.\n\nEmergence AI's orchestrator closes that gap. It thinks, acts, and improves without constant human guidance.\n\nThis isn't about replacing people. It's about removing the friction between having an idea and making it happen.\n\nRight now, translating business requirements into working software takes weeks or months. With systems like this, it takes minutes.\n\nThat speed changes everything. Planning cycles get shorter. Iteration gets faster. The distance between \"what if\" and \"let's try it\" shrinks to almost nothing.\n\nThe companies that figure this out first are going to move at a completely different pace than everyone else.\n\n* * *\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nEmergence AI built something that feels like science fiction but works like business software. An AI that builds other AIs based on what you actually need, not what someone thought you might need.\n\nIs it perfect? Probably not. Is it going to change how enterprise automation works? Absolutely.\n\nThe question isn't whether this technology will spread. The question is how fast your industry will adopt it and whether you'll be ready.\n\nWe're not just automating tasks anymore. We're automating the creation of automation itself.\n\nThat's a different game entirely.\n\n* * *\n\nWhat do you think? Are you ready for AI that builds itself, or does this feel like too much too fast? Drop a comment below - I'd love to hear whether this excites you or keeps you up at night.\n\nAnd if you found this breakdown helpful, share it with someone who needs to know about AI agents creating agents. This stuff moves fast, and staying ahead of the curve matters more than ever.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_like-toggle_like-cta)\n\n![Image 4: Like](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc)Like\n\n![Image 5: Celebrate](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc)Celebrate\n\n![Image 6: Support](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc)Support\n\n![Image 7: Love](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc)Love\n\n![Image 8: Insightful](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc)Insightful\n\n![Image 9: Funny](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc)Funny\n\n[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_comment-cta)\n\n*   Copy\n*   LinkedIn\n*   Facebook\n*   Twitter\n\n Share \n\n[![Image 10](https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/bn39hirwzjqj18ej1fkz55671) 2](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_likes-count_social-actions-reactions)\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\nMore articles by Daniel L.\n--------------------------\n\n*   [How Torque Clustering AI Algorithm Works: The Game-Changer That Makes Machines Learn Like Animals](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-torque-clustering-ai-algorithm-works-game-changer-lozovsky-mba-zzw0c)![Image 11](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-builds-other-ais-real-time-how-emergence-changes-lozovsky-mba-g31pc) Jul 11, 2025 \n### How Torque Clustering AI Algorithm Works: The Game-Changer That Makes Machines Learn Like Animals\n\nLook, I'm going to be straight with you.

Outdated, manual data pipelines are costing businesses astronomical amounts and keeping your smartest people stuck doing digital busywork.\n\nEmergence AI's CRAFT platform stands at the forefront of this revolution with its \"agents creating agents\" approach. The concept sounds deceptively simple: AI systems that can dynamically create specialized AI tools to handle specific tasks. But the implications are profound. Data scientists spend up to 90% of their time wrangling data rather than analyzing it. CRAFT flips that equation, cutting analysis time from days to minutes through intelligent automation that requires only natural language commands.\n\nWhat makes this particularly powerful is CARFT's self-improvement capabilities. The platform continuously learns through three dimensions: knowledge acquisition (gaining domain expertise), skill acquisition (optimizing workflows), and agent acquisition (building new capabilities). Like a new employee gaining experience, the system becomes increasingly valuable over time, adapting specifically to your business context.\n\nReal-world results already demonstrate the impact. Semiconductor manufacturers using CARFT identify yield issues in minutes instead of days, potentially saving millions weekly. Telecommunications companies report 70% reductions in data governance tasks. An online forum reduced unsafe image postings by 60 million monthly. The platform balances this power with built-in governance features, ensuring human oversight remains for critical decisions while shifting roles toward strategic direction rather than execution.\n\nAvailable now in private preview and launching broadly this summer, CARFT represents a fundamental shift in how enterprises handle data. The question isn't whether AI will transform your business operations—it's whether you'll be among the first to capitalize on this transformation or watch competitors race ahead while you're still stuck with yesterday's manual workflows.\nReal Talk About Marketing (https://www.acxiom.com/podcasts/) \n\n\nAn Acxiom podcast where we discuss marketing made better, bringing you

rare we get a chance to actually look behind the curtain see what's really changing how businesses work like at the ground level right there's so much noise out there exactly the pace of AI change it feels like this title wave of information doesn't it and it's genuinely hard sometimes to tell what's uh truly revolutionary versus what's just well hype mhm separating the signal from the noise precisely so today we're diving into something that honestly looks like it could cut right through that noise something that could deliver not just those aha moments but a a proper understanding of a really groundbreaking shift okay I'm intrigued yeah think of this as a shortcut a way for you to get properly informed on a topic that seems set to really redefine how enterprises operate especially around efficiency sounds important what are we focusing on so our mission for this deep dive is emergence AI's new platform it's called TFT and the really big idea behind it is this concept of agents creating agents agents creating agents okay and we're not just framing this as you know another cool AI tool it's positioned as a direct really powerful solution to one of the biggest most persistent and frankly most expensive problems in enterprise IT which is the whole mess of outdated manual data pipelines seriously this isn't some small niche issue it's a massive global challenge the sources we looked at estimate it cost businesses over $200 billion annually wow that's that's a staggering number just on managing data flows yep and CRFT comes in promising immediate real benefits think like dramatically faster insights from your data getting rid of all that tedious busy work involved in data prep and of course massive cost savings that hit the bottom line and how accessible is it that's often the catch with powerful tech well this is the kicker it's all accessible with natural language plain English you don't need a deep technical background apparently to tap into these really sophisticated AI capabilities potentially huge democratizing that kind of power exactly and one thing that really jumped out from the materials is that this isn't just about like making things a bit faster no it's pitched as a fundamental paradigm shift how companies manage data analyze it get strategic value from it it's moving away from that fragmented often manual reactive way of doing things towards something autonomous intelligent proactive you got it that's the promise anyway interesting so where are we getting this information from good question so for this deep dive we've pulled insights from a pretty detailed ask me anything session and AMA with emergence AI's co-founders and some of their key scientists and engineers straight from the source right and we've cross- referenced that with some good reporting from venturebe plus information directly from the emergence AI website we've basically sifted through it all to pull out the really important nuggets for you great so the goal is to get everyone up to speed quickly on the CRFT platform and the whole agents creating agents idea exactly so let's dive in let's start with that multibillion dollar problem crf is aiming to fix these data pipelines right what's the actual issue okay so think about a large company data isn't just in one neat place right it's scattered everywhere right legacy systems cloud apps spreadsheets exactly databases here data warehouses there maybe some sensor data over here customer data in a CRM that's fragmented siloed each piece is kind of stuck in its own corner and getting it all together for analysis is the challenge it's a massive challenge the traditional way involves these complex often manual and incredibly timeconuming processes just to bring that data together think of it like plumbing but really old leaky complicated plumbing and you said manual like people are actually doing this bit by bit often yes we're writing custom scripts for every little connection which constantly break or need updating when data formats change it's not just inconvenient it's a huge grain on resources time money people and that's where the $200 billion figure comes in it sounds almost unbelievable it does but when you break it down it makes sense first there's the sheer human effort teams of people just wrangling data moving it cleaning it trying to make sense of it okay second think about lost opportunities if it takes days or weeks to get the data ready for analysis decisions get delayed by the time you have the insight the market might have shifted or the opportunity is gone right the data is stale exactly and third manual processes are errorprone mistakes creep in when you're copying pasting transforming data by hand or with brittle scripts flawed data leads to flawed analysis which leads to bad strategies so it's not just cost it's risk and missed value too precisely and it disproportionately affects the people you'd think would be doing the highv value work the data scientists how so well the sources we looked at including insights from Emergence AI's team said you read that data scientists can spend up to 90% of their time on this preparatory stuff 90% that's almost their entire job pretty much data wrangling data cleaning data migration they're dealing with incompatible formats missing information weird naming conventions constant changes to how the data structured so they're experts in analysis but they're stuck being data janitors that's a blunt way to put it but yeah often their skills aren't being used for deep analysis or building those cool predictive models most of the day is just getting the data usable which really begs the question what if you could just flip that free them up to do the actual science part exactly let them focus on strategy on insight not on the plumbing okay so that sets the stage perfectly for craft how does it propose to flip that script right so CRFT and the acronym stands for create remember assemble fine-tune and trust is emergence AI's first big push into this space it's a data focused AI platform create remember assemble fine-tune trust got it and its core function sounds simple but the implications are huge it lets anyone and they really stress anyone from analysts right up to executives turn their business goals directly into these smart self-verifying multi-agent systems okay smart self-verifying multi-agent systems let's break that down smart implies intelligence multi-agent suggests some multiple AIs working together but self-verifying what does that mean that's a really crucial part it means the system doesn't just blindly execute a task it has built-in checks to validate its own work how does that work in practice imagine you ask it to pull data for a sales report a simple script might just grab the numbers a self-verifying agent though might automatically run consistency checks does this number align with last quarter's trend does it match data from the finance system it might cross reference things flag anomalies it finds ah so it's trying to catch errors before they get to me exactly instead of just handing you potentially flawed data it actively tries to ensure the output is reliable and trustworthy which you know in an enterprise setting that's absolutely critical you can't base million-dollar decisions on dodgy data absolutely and the interaction model you said plain English yeah that's the other revolutionary part you interact with it using plain old English just describe your goal what you need and apparently you get results back in minutes not days not weeks minutes so no complex coding no query language is needed that's the claim no deep technical background required it's about democratizing access to this kind of powerful automation imagine like you said collapsing weeks of work into minutes it's like it's a massive shift isn't it it really is it's like having this super efficient data team just on call ready instantly yeah and it's not just a concept it has concrete capabilities right out of the box like what what can it actually do from day one well it can talk to data in your databases and data warehouses and understands different structures different schemas SQL NoSQL data links you name it it can retrieve and process that information okay so it can fetch the data but more than that it can write code for instance it can automate building those complex ETL pipelines extract transform load oh the plumbing itself exactly those processes are notoriously fiddly and errorprone for humans moving data changing its format loading it somewhere else she raft can automate large parts of that data ingestion cleansing transformation a lot of that manual drudgery which connects back to that 90% figure for data scientists precisely and the co-founders are quite explicit tasks that used to take days weeks and months are now potentially doable in mere minutes it's not just incremental improvement then it's a whole different order of magnitude right it feels like it elevates AI to manage higher levels of abstraction it solves bigger chunks of the problem that people used to handle manually and at a speed and scale that was just unthinkable before shifting the bottleneck from human time to compute time yeah that's a good way to think about it okay so QRFT is powerful but you mentioned the really core innovation is this idea of agents creating agents that sounds kind of sci-fi what does it actually mean yeah it does sound a bit out there at first but before we get to the creating agents part let's make sure we're clear on what an AI agent is in this context good idea lay the groundwork so traditional software as we sort of touched on is mostly static you give it commands it follows them step A step B step C that's right it executes a script exactly agents are different they're designed to chase outcomes they adapt ashish one of the scientists at emergence AI gave a really neat definition he said \"An agent is an entity that can sense reason plan and then can act.\" Sense reason plan act okay sense means observing its environment maybe reading data from a database looking at a web page processing a document reason means interpreting that information understanding it in the context of its goal plan means figuring out a strategy a sequence of steps to achieve the goal and act well doing those steps so it's not just following a pre-written recipe it's figuring out the recipe and cooking the meal that's a great analogy yes and importantly when it acts it can change the state of the world like writing code updating a database sending a notification but just as importantly it can change its own state by acquiring knowledge meaning it learns exactly it learns from what worked what didn't it updates its internal understanding its strategies that self-modification is key okay an emergence AI says these agentic systems are good at tasks needing multiple reasoning steps and using multiple tools right think about a complex request maybe analyzing sales data an agent might need to first query the sales database tool one then use a statistical analysis library tool two on the results then generate a chart using a visualization tool tool three and finally write a summary report tool four and agent coordinates that whole workflow intelligently got it so they're like smart autonomous project managers for specific tasks yeah that's the fair way to think about it okay n agents creating agents how does that work this is where it gets really interesting for me right so this is the ACA agents creating agents breakthrough the idea is when you give Chery a task you the user don't need to know if there's already a perfect pre-built agent for it you don't need to figure out how to chain different agents together the system handles that complexity exactly there's this orchestrator which they describe as a kind of meta agent an agent overseeing other agents and this orchestrator figures it all out it dynamically creates new agents on the fly if it needs to creates them from scratch well it might be more accurate to say it composes them it assesses the task breaks it down then it looks at its library of existing agents the big powerful ones but if there's a specific gap a very niche requirement for this particular task it builds something custom for that gap precisely it composes existing agents and new agents to accomplish your task it might generate a small piece of code a specific function essentially a mini agent just for that one step okay that makes more sense than building whole complex agents from zero every time right viv like who works on agent engineering there used a really helpful metaphor he talks about existing agents as big rocks these are your general purpose powerhouses maybe a web automation agent a complex data analysis agent so okay the standard toolkit yeah but the dynamically created agents those are the little rocks they fill in the spaces for these really niche problems ah like packing sand around the big rocks to make a solid structure exactly so say your big data agent needs one specific piece of info from some weird internal report format it's never seen the orchestrator might spin up a temporary little rock agent just to parse that specific report format for that one piece of data then it plugs that result back into the main workflow wow so the system adapts its own toolkit on the fly that's the core of it and that dynamic creation and composition is what makes it in their words truly agentic it's not just executing it's planning reasoning breaking down tasks composing solutions and crucially verifying the results and improving itself along the way and you mentioned improvement these little rock agents if they work well do they stick around apparently yes if a dynamically created component or workflow proves effective and useful it can be saved remembered and reused so the system gets smarter and more efficient over time it's like that new employee analogy again they learn a new skill they become more valuable so the big takeaway here is this AI isn't just smart it's adaptively smart it's constantly learning growing tailoring itself to my specific business needs that seems to be the fundamental idea a system that gets better with you which is a massive edge in a world that changes so fast that adaptability brings us neatly to the next point this idea of self-improvement in memory it sounds like it's baked right into the system absolutely it's not an add-on it's core to how these care agents operate they don't just run a task and forget about it they learn they improve they have self-improvement capabilities fueled by long-term memory and how do they build up this experience just by doing the tasks we give them that's part of it yes they learn through usage seeing what works getting feedback implicitly or explicitly but what's really interesting is they also learn through self-exloration self-exloration what does that mean like they practice in their downtime kind of it implies they might proactively test different ways to solve a problem they've encountered before even when not actively tasked or maybe explore adjacent data sources look for patterns actively seeking ways to optimize their own internal methods it's more proactive than just waiting for the next assignment okay that's a subtle but important distinction it's not just passive learning right and Ashish broke down this self-improvement through memory into three key dimensions first is knowledge acquisition gaining more facts more than just facts it's about learning specialized domain knowledge think about industries like semiconductors or biotech they have incredibly specific jargon complex processes unique physics the agents learn this context so they speak the language of the business yes and beyond that formal knowledge they also pick up tacet knowledge the stuff that's usually not written down like office politics huh maybe not quite that but more like the unwritten rules of how things actually get done in a specific company operational nuances who the real expert on system X is maybe even subtle approval workflows this stuff is critical for fitting smoothly into an organization's real processes okay that makes sense embedding itself in the culture almost what's the second dimension second is skill acquisition this is about process once an agent figures out a really effective way to do something maybe the fastest way to query a particular database or the best technique for cleaning a certain type of messy data that knowledge that skill is persistent it remembers the how-to exactly it internalizes that optimal workflow and reuses it so the system gets more efficient more reliable over time as she's compared it to a new employee picking up new skills they get better faster more dependable at their job it's not just remembering facts it's remembering how to do things well right learning best practices and the third dimension the third one ties back to our earlier discussion new agent creation acquisition this is where the system doesn't just improve existing agents or skills it actually builds or acquires entirely new capabilities new agents as it runs into new kinds of problems so its overall potential grows over time precisely its scope expands its ability to tackle more diverse and complex challenges increases dynamically it's this hierarchy knowledge skills new capabilities that creates this compounding intelligence effect making it more valuable the more you use it that's the idea and they have a concrete example of this in action they used craftist to help build itself right the dog fooding example eating your own dog food exactly they used craft it internally to automate writing code for connecting different internal systems needed for craft his own development like connecting their analytics database to their CRM you mentioned yeah things like that instead of engineers manually scripting those connections Kiraf learned the requirements learned the schemas and built those data bridges automatically it saved their own team significant manual coding effort that's pretty compelling it shows immediate practical value even for building the tool itself it does it demonstrates that the self-improvement and automation aren't just theoretical they deliver real productivity gains right away so the upshot of all this learning and memory the system gets smarter it adapts it tailor itself to your specific business context that feels like a significant competitive advantage it certainly seems positioned that way an intelligence that evolves with your enterprise okay so we've got this powerful learning agent creating platform where is it actually making waves what kind of real world impact are we seeing [Music] if you're a podcast host or someone wanting to be interviewed on podcast as a guest visit podmatch.com podmatch automatically connects ideal podcast guests and hosts together for interviews we always say it works just like a

you countless hours of administrative work through built-in automations if you're ready to level up your podcast interviews on either side of the mic start today by visiting podmatch.com well emergence AI is pretty clear that Craft is purposebuilt for data heavy environments where rapid decision-m is critical so industries drowning in data exactly places where the sheer volume velocity and variety of data make manual analysis incredibly slow errorprone or just plain impossible they list several key industries already seeing impact semiconductors is a big one and we should definitely dig into that but also oil and gas telecommunications healthcare financial services supply chain and logistics e-commerce and even research environments that's a pretty broad range all data inensive though very much so places where delays mean lost money or missed opportunities and where complexity is high okay let's do that deep dive into semiconductors you said it's a prime example of ROI absolutely the semiconductor industry is just incredibly data intensive we're talking hundreds of gigabytes of data per product weekly maybe even more now wow where does all that data come from every stage designing the chip the actual fabrication and the fabs those super clean factories then offshore assembly and testing facilities mhm plus data from the fabulous companies themselves like design specs customer requirements quality targets it's a deluge from multiple disperate sources and the challenge is making sense of it all quickly precisely a key problem is detecting subtle drops in manufacturing yield we're not just talking about a simple alert if yield falls below 90% it's often about spotting subtle downward trends hidden in noisy data or complex anomalies that aren't just a single parameter going wrong things that are hard for a human to spot just by looking at dashboards very hard especially when you need to correlate data across all those different sources the fab the assembly plant the design data maybe a tiny temperature fluctuation in one machine in the fab combined with a specific material batch used weeks ago is causing a slight increase in failures during final testing overseas connecting those dots sounds incredibly difficult it is it requires pulling data from multiple systems often with different formats different timestamps different owners doing that root cause analysis manually is described as almost impossible for humans to be on top of efficiently the sources say analysis typically takes days days and in some conductor manufacturing days mean potentially millions of dollars lost right easily if a yield issue isn't caught and fixed quickly you could be producing thousands of faulty chips that's wasted materials lost production capacity potential delays to customers it adds up incredibly fast so how does CRFT help here it automates that whole detection and root cause analysis process instead of days the analysis time gets cut down to minutes they give an example of offline analysis taking maybe 20 30 minutes instead of several days from days to minutes that's the game changer it really is yeah and the value is crystal clear they talk about identifying issues that lead to millions in weekly savings because companies can take immediate actions to counteract anomalies catch it early fix it fast save a fortune and crucially what about the engineers are they being replaced no and this is a point they emphasize the agents complement the skill sets of the existing engineers hardware engineers are experts in chip design materials physics their core job isn't usually data science or AI programming right they're domain experts not necessarily data wranglers exactly so Craft frees them up from digging through log files and spreadsheets it gives them the insights they need quickly so they can focus on what they are best at solving the underlying engineering problem improving the design tweaking the manufacturing process it augments their expertise that makes sense empowering the experts not replacing them are there other strong examples outside of semiconductors yes several and telecom for instance they report a 70% reduction in the time spent on data governance tasks data governance that sounds important but maybe a bit dry it's critical in regulated industries think about ensuring compliance with GDPR CCPA tracking where data came from and who accessed it data lineage enforcing policies classifying sensitive info it's hugely timeconuming and often manual automating 70% of that is a massive efficiency win okay yeah I can see the value there less risk less overhead then there's a fascinating case with a large online forum they used AI agents to help reduce the number of unsafe images being posted by 60 million per month 60 million that's staggering scale it is and it's likely not just simple image filtering it probably involves understanding context maybe analyzing text associated with the image applying complex moderation rules at a scale humans just couldn't handle it lets human moderators focus on the really tricky nuance cases improving safety and probably reducing moderator burnout too very likely and another really interesting one is the integration with Nimmerson specifically their O plus solution for complex manufacturing what was the challenge there aaron Rouso from Nimer explained it well he said previously manual analysis of production data was so slow that by the time analysis was complete the next production batch was underway insights were always too late to actually influence the current process so purely reactive exactly with Craft integrated they get real time insights aligned with complex production workflows this allows for improving yields and accelerating issue detection imagine a sensor flag something subtle craft analyzes it instantly correlates it maybe suggests an adjustment before defects start happening that's proactive control that real time aspect seems key in dynamic environments absolutely and beyond these industrial cases the demos on the emergence AI website show even more potential research analysis summarizing academic papers pulling out key findings even spotting conflicting results and sending it all to Confluence saving researchers hours of reading time for sure e-commerce competitive analysis comparing platforms like Shopify and Wix on features pricing market positioning health insurance insights pulling investment and M&A data from dense financial reports gene therapy market analysis from SEC filings even summarizing the huge WHO global nutrition report wow it seems applicable anywhere there's complex information or data that needs extracting synthesizing or analyzing quickly that's the impression it's acting like a highly efficient intelligent knowledge worker across a very broad range of tasks okay this is undeniably powerful stuff which naturally leads to the big question trust control privacy security compliance how do you manage AI agents that are becoming increasingly autonomous that sounds like a major concern for any enterprise it's a huge concern and rightly so robbie the co-founder and CTO at Emergence AI was very clear that governance isn't an add-on it's designed in as a core design principle meaning it's built in from the start not bolted on later exactly the idea is that enterprises themselves should define the rules the policies they specify what agents can and cannot do for example a policy might state no agent can access personally identifiable information without specific anonymization steps or any financial transaction initiated by an agent requires sign off from a specific manager so the company sets the boundaries and the system enforces them right mechanisms are built into Craft to enforce these policies things like granular access controls detailed audit logs tracking every action an agent takes and limiting the action space or capabilities available to certain agents based on policy and what about human oversight is it all just automated rules no and this is critical they stress the concept of human in the loop while the goal is more autonomy human oversight is still considered essential especially for critical decisions or actions so the system might do the analysis maybe even propose an action but a human gives the final okay precisely it's about ensuring the agents actions always align with the company's principles ethics and compliance needs it's collaborative intelligence not handing over the keys completely the system flags things that need human review and provides the context for that decision that makes sense it's about augmenting human judgment not replacing it entirely and this ties into how workforce roles are likely to change satya the CEO used a really interesting analogy with self-driving cars oh yeah how so he pointed out that even with level five autonomy fully self-driving there's still likely a human in the loop somewhere maybe overseeing a fleet from a control center even if they aren't physically in the car he sees a parallel in the enterprise so humans shift from doing the task to managing the system that does the task exactly the role evolves from doing all the coding or building the agents yourself to overseeing these systems nudging these systems ensuring they stay within guard rails and making sure the outputs meet the business requirements it's a supervisory strategic role that sounds like a different skill set though it absolutely is satcha called them new skills even metacognitive skills that people have to be taught things like understanding how agents reason how to formulate problems effectively for an AI how to interpret their outputs critically and how to define and monitor those crucial guard rails it's less about execution and more about orchestration and governance well put and recognizing this need emergence AI has actually partnered with Andela and Andela the global tech talent company that's the one they're working together to specifically train engineers and data scientists for this new reality training them to go from having to build agents to manage agents and govern agents and work with agents that's proactive addressing the skills gap headon it seems so the training focuses on things like advanced prompt engineering for guiding agents debugging agent workflows setting up monitoring and defining those governance policies effectively and the long-term vision is it just for techies no the ultimate vision they articulate is that even business users with some analytical skills should be able to work with systems like this and derive value instantly so further democratization empowering a broader range of people within the enterprise okay let's dig into the tech a bit more interoperability is always a huge issue in enterprise IT how does craft play with existing tools and what about all the different AI models out there open AI anthropic meta is it locked into one great questions and according to Vive interoperability was a first class design goal right from the start yeah they seem very committed to not creating another silo how do they achieve that what are the mechanisms several things they offer open API specifications so other systems can integrate with KiF they have an SDK a software development kit for developers who want to build custom integrations or extensions and critically they've fully adopted something called MCP mcp model context protocol what is that think of it like a universal translator and capability directory for AI models and agents it allows different AI systems even from competing vendors to understand each other's requests data formats function calls and context kaf can act as both an MCP client using other MCP enabled tools and an MCP server allowing other tools to use Kurass capabilities okay so MCP is key for making different AI systems talk to each other without custom hacks that's the promise of it yes enables a more open interoperable AI ecosystem within a company and which AI models does KIA actually support they're explicitly model agnostic they support a range of the big ones right now open AI's GBT40 and 4.5 Anthropics Claw 3.7 Sonnet Metislama 3.3 and they also support popular orchestration frameworks that developers might already be using like Langchain Crew AI and Microsoft Autogen so companies aren't locked into one specific LLM vendor correct they can choose the best models for the job or use models they already have access to and emergence AI runs continuous benchmarking activity to track how these models perform ensure results are consistent or deterministic as they say even as the underlying models get updated or drift over time that model drift is a real concern isn't it an update to an LLM could break a workflow it absolutely can so that continuous benchmarking and focus on determinism is really important for enterprise reliability it raises a broader question though how vital is this open model agnostic approach for the long-term success of enterprise AI it feels like a smart strategy in such a fastmoving field it definitely provides flexibility and future proofing okay looking ahead what's on the road map for Craft they started with data pipelines but where do they go next right they're clear that the current focus on the data space is strategic it's where they can deliver high accuracy reliability task completion and demonstrate that clear ROI we talked about focusing on tangible value first exactly they acknowledge that the dream of a completely general open-ended orchestrator like a true AGI that can do anything is still a way off and requires major research breakthroughs so they're being pragmatic about the current scope yes but they have ambitious plans to expand on the base platform layer they're planning more connectors especially using MCP to talk to even more tools and data sources they're building out agent deployment and scheduling so you can run agents automatically on a schedule or trigger them based on events like new data arriving making them more proactive and integrated into workflows right and interestingly in the next 3 to 6 months they plan to add code viewing and editing capabilities ah so developers can see the code the agents generate and maybe tweak it that seems to be the idea more transparency more control better debugging plus ongoing work on improving the human in the loop experience making that interaction smoother okay that's the platform layer what about the data capabilities themselves they're expanding there too across three main areas first more sophisticated agentic data analysis agents doing more advanced stats finding trends maybe even generating hypotheses autonomously going beyond just fetching and cleaning second deeper capabilities in data governance things like automatically building data cataloges assessing and enriching metadata monitoring data quality continuously automating more of that critical but often burdensome work automating the compliance and quality checks and third enhancing data engineering capabilities this includes automating pipeline creation and optimization maybe even self-healing pipelines that can fix themselves if they encounter problems oh it sounds like they're aiming for comprehensive agentic control over the whole enterprise data life cycle that seems to be the direction starting focused then systematically expanding outwards to cover more and more ground so it feels like we're watching the early stages of a really adaptable intelligence taking shape starting with data but with potential far beyond i think that's a fair assessment okay this is all incredibly exciting for people listening who are thinking I want to try this or my company needs this how can they get started with Craft right now Craft is available in a private preview this is mainly aimed at developers and integrators who want early access to test it out build on it provide feedback so not quite general release yet not quite broader availability for general enterprise use is planned for later this summer interested developers or companies can go to the emergence AI website right now and sign up for that preview program and what if a large enterprise has a really specific urgent need they mentioned that direct engagements are also possible on a case-by case basis so reaching out directly via the website would be the way to go and as we mentioned there are demos on the site too which give a good feel for what the platform can do good to know and what about pricing any idea how that will work they've outlined three planned tiers there'll be a free tier which sounds great for individuals wanting to experiment and just kick the tires lowering the barrier to entry then a pro tier which will be costbased and offer more capabilities higher usage limits probably aimed at power users or small teams okay and finally an enterprise tier this will have custom pricing likely based on usage scale and specific needs it will include advanced governance features maybe dedicated infrastructure support tailored solutions for bigger organizations that tiered approach makes sense start free scale up as needed seems designed to encourage adoption and learning all right as we start to wrap up this deep dive it leaves me with a thought we live in this world that's just drowning in information right data everywhere complex workflows slowing everyone down mhm the daily reality for many businesses so maybe the biggest productivity unlock isn't just finding ways to do our current tasks a bit faster maybe it's about getting smarter at designing the systems that do those tasks for us what if the real edge comes from creating and managing these evolving fleets of AI agents that learn your business adapt to your needs and free up your people for the really high impact strategic thinking that's a powerful idea and it raises a really important question doesn't it as these agents get better at creating and managing other agents essentially building layers of autonomous capability what does that free us up to do what new frontiers of human creativity innovation and strategic planning does that unlock when we're freed from the drudgery how do a role shift from task execution to maybe system conceptualization and orchestration focusing on the truly human skills of innovation and complex problem solving at a higher level that's definitely something to ponder wow that was quite the journey into the world of agents creating agents with emergence AI's Sukcraftraft i hope for everyone listening you feel much more informed now and maybe even a bit inspired to think differently about where AI is heading in the enterprise indeed it's fascinating stuff and knowledge is always most valuable when you can actually understand it and think about how to apply it hopefully this conversation has provided some powerful insights for you to do just that couldn't agree more thank you for joining us on this edition of The Deep Dive we look forward to exploring more fascinating topics with you again soon"

The platform comprises self-improving agents built by Emergence, in addition to variant agents that the platform creates when necessary. Through a plan-execute-verify framework, our platform efficiently identifies the best composition of agents that work for a given task, and iterates on these agents as needed to dynamically solve a superset of tasks in several domains such as test automation or data intelligence.\n\nEmergence partners with companies across a broad range of industries ranging from supply chain management to semi-conductor manufacturing. Any company aiming to simplify complex workflows, manage diverse applications, and/or enhance system integration should be thinking about the potential of multi-agent systems.\n\nThe Orchestrator Platform dynamically plans workflow execution during design time or when the environment changes (including changes in the functionality of applications and agents) and locks the working plans to be used during run-time where the environment is as expected. The Orchestratorâs dynamic planning capabilities enable it to flexibly address a wide range of enterprise use cases, spanning from QA test automation to data-centered chat. Our approach to agentic systems building is grounded in modern distributed computing principles, which offers key benefits such as: scalability, greater fault tolerance and reliability, and improved adaptability to environmental changes (e.g. databases, applications, and services).\n\nOur platform is built with integration and interoperability in mind; customers bring their own tools, data, and AI (models and agents). Our platform currently includes the Agent Registry (which catalogues Emergence, enterprise-specific, and third-party agents), services and data registries that connect these agents with tools/apps/data, and an Agent Software Development Kit to introduce non-Emergence agents in the platform. We also offer flexible deployment options for optimal scalability, security, and compatibility with existing systems.\n\nWe base our annual contract pricing on several factors, which include solution complexity, number of solutions used, and usage volumes. Once we speak about your enterpriseâs specific needs, we can customize a quote for you.\n\n### See what Emergence can do for you.\n\nLetâs set up a demo\n\n#### OUR OFFICES\n\n##### New York (HQ)\n\n8 W 40th St   \nFloor 20  \nNew York NY 10018\n\n##### Irvine (West Coast Office)\n\n16511 Scientific Way  \nSuite 100  \nIrvine CA 92618\n\n##### India\n\n2nd Floor, 25, Phoenix Citadel, Castle   \nSt, Ashok Nagarâ¨  \nBengaluru, Karnataka 560025\n\nÂ© emergence 2025.

Emergence AI has introduced an advanced orchestration platform that challenges the status quo of what artificial intelligence can do. Rather than another incremental feature set, Emergence's flagship product represents a push toward self-improving AI: _agents that build and refine other agents._\n\nHow did we get here? For years, the talk around AI's potential to evolve itself has mostly been confined to white papers and futuristic musings. A key missing piece of the puzzle—the ability for AI agents to autonomously design other AI agents and multi-agent systems. Now, Emergence's orchestrator is demonstrating exactly this. It's not merely an AI assisting humans; it's an AI building agents to solve tasks, spinning up specialized variants, and, crucially, self-improving in the process.\n\n_\"Recursive intelligence paves the path for agents to create agents, and it does not stop there,\"_ says Satya Nitta, Emergence's Co-founder and CEO. These words are more than a tagline; they're a roadmap. The orchestration platform, a meta-agent of sorts, identifies any gap in its agent registry and proceeds to create a new agent or multi-agent from scratch—setting objectives, evaluating progress, iterating until it hits its goal, and then saving that creation for future use.\n\nOn the enterprise side, this opens up an immediate set of possibilities. Data migration, analytics, compliance—these once-cumbersome processes can now be handed over to an AI system that intelligently coordinates and updates itself without endless back-and-forth from human developers. If a particular data transformation tool doesn't exist, the platform simply spawns a new agent to handle it. When a derivative challenge emerges, the platform anticipates the need and creates another variation. It's a self-perpetuating ecosystem of specialized AI services, built and managed at machine speed.\n\nBut Nitta makes it clear that Emergence sees something bigger on the horizon. _\"We envision creating more complex agents and, ultimately, truly powerful and intelligent systems with this capability.\"_\n\nAGI, though still speculative, promises adaptive, human-like reasoning across domains. While some in the industry have defined AGI as a distant milestone, Emergence's orchestrator has introduced a feasible mechanism for how AI might bootstrap its own development.\n\nThat's precisely what gets experts talking. Recursively improving AI isn't just a technical leap; it's a philosophical one. Humans, so far, have been the designers, the testers, and the ultimate judges of what AI can and should do. By letting AI conceive, test, and refine new agents without constant human oversight, albeit with guardrails—it's the closest the field has come to an engine that drives its own evolution.\n\n_\"Our systems allow creativity and intelligence to scale fluidly, without human bottlenecks, but always within human-defined boundaries,\"_ Nitta notes. _\"_ _Crucially, this demonstration is rooted in years of research from the autonomous agent community. It marks the first step in what promises to be an exciting and rapidly evolving journey_ _.\"_\n\nThe branching possibilities of such a system are hard to overstate. As soon as an agent demonstrates a new capability, that knowledge is fed back into the registry. The next time a similar challenge arises, the platform picks up where it left off, each iteration building on the last. While the enterprise use cases—like streamlining complicated data pipelines—are immediate and tangible, it's easy to imagine consumer products and research laboratories adapting the platform to push innovation even further.\n\nEmergence isn't doing this alone. The platform interconnects with GPT, Llama, and numerous other large language or domain-specific models. It also offers an SDK for third-party agent onboarding. This interoperability ensures that Emergence's approach isn't siloed—new ideas can flow in both directions. It's a flexible system that could become the glue holding together countless AI innovations across different industries.\n\nHowever, the most game-changing aspect might be the overarching feedback loop. As each agent is generated and refined, it captures data on what worked and what didn't, using those insights to adapt to complex conditions. Whether it's software testing, data regulation compliance, or more complex cognitive tasks, the ability to propagate new agents and learn from their successes and failures represents a kind of synthetic evolution. Combine that with the meta-agent's proactive variant creation—its ability to spin off parallel solutions for anticipated challenges—and you have a system evolving in multiple directions simultaneously.\n\nThe immediate gains for businesses are obvious: faster workflows, a frictionless way to integrate AI into existing systems, and a solution that actively grows with organizational needs. Over time, this could lead to leaps in fields beyond enterprise data management—everything from drug discovery to climate modeling might benefit from the system's capacity for adaptive, near-infinite iteration. _\"While still in its early stages, we are committed to rapidly advancing this challenging AI capability, with a strong focus on ensuring it is reliable, safe, and verifiably aligned with its intended goals,\"_ Nitta notes.\n\nⓒ 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

productivity\n\n![Image 23](https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/11/C1-2051-12-x2-80x80-96x96.jpg)\n\nby [Mike Wheatley](https://siliconangle.com/author/mikewheatley/)\n\n![Image 24](https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/themes/siliconangle/img/share.png)SHARE\n\n[Emergence AI](https://www.emergence.ai/), a generative artificial intelligence startup that’s focused on enhancing the productivity of business employees, said today it has closed on a $97.2 million funding round led by Learn Capital.\n\nAdding to those funds, it has also secured lines of credit totaling more than $100 million, the startup said.For a company that says it’s only now exiting stealth mode, that adds up to a huge amount of money, and it suggests that the company has, at the very least, grand ambitions.\n\nThose ambitions fall in the area of [generative AI “agents”](https://www.emergence.ai/blog/self-improving-agents) that go further than simply responding to user’s queries and prompts, and actually perform various work-related tasks on behalf of human users.\n\nThe startup, which is a division of the educational chatbot company [Merlyn Mind Inc.](https://www.merlyn.org/), is working on [an “agent-based” AI system](https://www.emergence.ai/blog/introducing-emergence) that can perform many of the jobs commonly performed by knowledge workers. It does this not with its own AI models, but by understanding what must be done and outsourcing those tasks to third-party models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o.\n\nEmergence’s main project, known as “Agent E,” is aimed at automating tasks such as completing forms, searching for products on retail websites and finding content on streaming services such as Netflix. The company has already created and open-sourced a prototype of Agent E that’s trained on both human-annotated and synthetic data.\n\n### Orchestrating LLMs\n\nEmergence co-founder and Chief Executive Satya Nitta [told TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/24/emergence-thinks-it-can-crack-the-ai-agent-code/) in an interview that Agent E is best described as an “orchestrator,” which acts like an intermediary, processing users’ requests and finding the most suitable large language model to complete that task. For example, if a user requests Agent E to write an email, it will understand that request and then find the best model to do it, based on a curated list of LLMs.\n\nThe CEO said developers who integrate Agent E in their applications will have a lot of flexibility in terms of what they can do. For instance, they can “switch to the latest open source or generalist model on demand, without having to worry about issues such as cost, prompt migration or availability,” he said.\n\nNitta told TechCrunch that he started Emergence after realizing that some of the technologies developed at Merlyn Mind could be applied to automating various business tasks. He explained that while existing LLMs have extremely powerful capabilities in terms of language understanding, they lack the planning and reasoning skills needed to perform complex automation tasks, even if they understand the user’s request.\n\nAlthough Agent E is open-source, Emergence eventually wants to monetize its orchestrator tool through a premium, subscription-based application programming interface. That service will be capable of performing almost any work-related task, Nitta said. For instance, it will be able to process claims and documents, manage information technology systems, handle customer service duties and more.\n\nThe startup has already entered into strategic partnerships with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Newline Interactive Inc., and is planning to integrate its AI orchestrator tech into those companies’ products. Initially, those partnerships will focus on display technologies, and we can expect to see AI productivity functions in Samsung’s WAD interactive displays and Newline’s Q and Q Pro displays, Nitta said.\n\nEmergence claims to be doing something novel, but it appears to have quite a few rivals that are also focused specifically on creating more capable AI agents. Those rivals include the likes of Google LLC and OpenAI, as well as startups such as [Sierra Technologies Inc.](https://sierra.ai/), which is [developing conversational AI agents](https://siliconangle.com/2024/02/13/sierra-announces-launch-conversational-ai-platform-customer-service/) that can take actions on behalf of employees. Others include [Orby AI Inc.](https://www.orby.ai/), which is training AI agents to work with a range of desktop software, and [Adept AI Labs Inc](https://www.adept.ai/)., another AI automation startup that claims to be focused on “general intelligence.”\n\nIt remains to be seen which of these companies will ultimately come out on top in the nascent field of AI agents, or indeed, if any of them will even succeed. It’s notable that Adept AI, despite [raising a bumper $350 million funding round](https://siliconangle.com/2023/03/14/adept-creator-ai-assistant-automates-software-tasks-raises-350m/) in March 2023, is reportedly now [short of funds](https://fortune.com/2024/06/18/ai-startup-adept-microsoft-deal-talks/) and desperately [seeking a bailout](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-denies-interest-in-buying-ai-startup-adept) from companies including Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n##### Image: SiliconANGLE/Microsoft Designer\n\n* * *\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\n========================================================\n\n### Your vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\n\n### One click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\n\n### [Join our community on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu3Ri8DI1RQLdVtU12uIp1Q?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n### Join the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n**“TheCUBE is an important partner to the industry.

real-time\n\n![Image 23](https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/11/C1-2051-12-x2-80x80-96x96.jpg)\n\nby [Mike Wheatley](https://siliconangle.com/author/mikewheatley/)\n\n![Image 24](https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/themes/siliconangle/img/share.png)SHARE\n\n[Emergence AI](https://www.emergence.ai/) is emerging from the shadows with a fresh take on artificial intelligence agents, using them to create yet more agents that can perform more complicated tasks on behalf of workers.\n\nThe startup today announced the launch of a new, automated AI agent creation platform that doesn’t require any coding skills. Instead, human users can simply tell it what they’re trying to accomplish using natural language prompts. The platform will then fire up its AI agents, which will then set about creating more specialized AI agents to complete the designated task.\n\nEmergence AI’s new agent builder was first reported by VentureBeat, which [describes the system](https://venturebeat.com/ai/emergence-ais-new-system-automatically-creates-ai-agents-rapidly-in-realtime-based-on-the-work-at-hand/) as a “no code, natural language, AI-powered multi-agent builder” that works in real time. According to the startup, its platform represents a new milestone in the area of “recursive intelligence,” which refers to AI systems that can improve themselves over time without human intervention.\n\nAccording to co-founder and Chief Executive Satya Nitta, recursive intelligence is the secret sauce that makes it possible for AI agents to create new AI agents.“Our systems allow creativity and intelligence to scale fluidly without human bottlenecks, but always within human-defined boundaries,” he told VentureBeat.\n\nWhen it’s presented with an incoming task, Emergence AI will evaluate the work that needs to be performed and then check its existing registry of AI agents to see if they are capable of doing that work. If not, it will then set about autonomously creating new agents that can fulfil the requested task, and those newly built agents will get to work on the problem straight away.\n\nTaking it further, Emergence AI can also proactively create additional AI agents that will anticipate related tasks that need to be fulfilled, based on the user’s previous requests.\n\n“The orchestrator figures out if it can solve the task by checking the registry of existing agents,” Nitta said. “If it can’t, it creates a new agent and registers it.”\n\n![Image 25](https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/04/Screenshot-from-2025-04-02-07-47-33.png)\n\nThe platform is also able to stitch together multiple AI agents and have them work with one another in a fully autonomous way, enabling a new level of enterprise automation, the company claims.\n\nWith regard to the underlying large language models that power Emergence AI’s agents, Nitta said customers can choose from leading LLMs including OpenAI’s GPT-4o reasoning model or GPT-4.5, Anthropic PBC’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama 3.3 and many more. He added that the company has put a lot of emphasis on interoperability, so enterprises can also bring their own models and use them to power the AI agents its platform creates.\n\nThe startup is targeting a wide range of use cases for its Ai agents, including data-centric tasks such as extract, transact and load pipeline creation, transformation, migration and analytics. In addition, it’s also hoping to improve generative AI coding, which is an area where mistakes are still often made. According to Nitta, the idea is to marry LLM’s code generating capabilities with autonomous agents that can verify the code they generate, and then suggest fixes if any problems show up.\n\n“Agentic coding has enormous implications and will be the story of the next year and the next several years,” Nitta said.\n\nEmergence AI has implemented a number of safeguards and compliance features in place to maintain oversight of its AI agents. These include general safety guardrails to prevent agents from misbehaving, access controls and verification rubrics that assess the performance of its agents. Most importantly, though, there’s always a human in the loop, Nitta said.\n\n“You need to verify that the multi-agent system or the new agents spawned are doing the task you want and went in the right direction,” he pointed out.\n\nThe startup has not disclosed pricing for its AI agent-powered AI agent platform, but anyone who is interested in the concept is invited to contact the company directly for details on access and costs.\n\n##### Image: SiliconANGLE/Microsoft Designer\n\n* * *\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\n========================================================\n\n### Your vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\n\n### One click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\n\n### [Join our community on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu3Ri8DI1RQLdVtU12uIp1Q?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n### Join the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n**“TheCUBE is an important partner to the industry.

The early AI-first companies built their AI tech stacks from scratch. Today, as powerful generative AI foundational models have been made publicly available, new companies are adopting AI into their existing workflows and software applications faster than ever before. Companies, including several in our portfolio like [Doximity](https://www.emcap.com/portfolio/doximity), [Ironclad](https://www.emcap.com/portfolio/ironclad), and [Saleo](https://www.emcap.com/portfolio/saleo), have been experimenting with these foundational models and LLMs across numerous facets of their operations, from deploying AI copilots to using AI to power key internal workflows and customer interactions.\n\nAs enterprises become more innovative (and sophisticated) with their use of LLMs, they are realizing that they want more ownership and control over the AI models they use. Enterprises can’t rely solely on closed models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which are black boxes with no defensibility. It’s our belief that the most sophisticated enterprises will leverage tens if not hundreds of AI models simultaneously, including proprietary models they pre-train from scratch, open source models fine-tuned to their specific needs, and closed models. To facilitate the surge in enterprise AI adoption, we need a new AI infrastructure stack that is focused on speed, cost-effectiveness, transparency, security, and control of your proprietary data/IP.\n\n![Image 1](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67d0b820a9e389b3a4bb52a1/682e334284dc06d0af79199c_67d95cb7e15b39770b9429f2_updated_website_image.png)\n\n### Building the foundation for generative AI\n\nCompanies that want to build AI-powered applications and workflows need access to three things (all of which are incredibly limited today):\n\n*   **AI knowledge: The experience and knowledge required to pre-train or fine-tune foundational models to build unique AI products.** Right now, there simply aren’t that many AI researchers with the necessary breadth and depth of model-building knowledge. More are becoming fluent in AI tech everyday as the industry develops, but there is a gap in supply and demand.\n*   **Compute:****The GPUs necessary to train AI models.** Companies that provide access to GPUs have limited availability due to capacity constraints from GPU manufacturers. This will not be a problem forever as the production scales with time and access increases, but right now, the limited amount of compute is a critical challenge for the overall industry to solve in order to keep up with the rising enterprise demand for AI infrastructure. \n*   **AI Tooling: The software that enables companies to transform raw data into useful AI models.** In order to train or tune a foundational model, enterprises need to clean and tag data, structure that data into a database, and then run algorithms to pre-train a model with that data. Once a model is pre-trained, in order to get value, an enterprise needs to host that model, run inference queries against it, and use the result in an application or workflow. Today, this lifecycle is siloed and mostly manual at each step.\n\nEach of these three elements is essential to developing AI-powered enterprise applications, however today, they are also bottlenecks. As a result, only a fraction of software companies are truly capable of leveraging proprietary AI models. Once AI infrastructure becomes widely available and tooling matures, we believe all software companies will incorporate generative AI into workflows and applications.\n\nUltimately, we believe there will be more winners created in the AI software application layer, and these winners will come in multiple flavors. Whether these apps are replacing human-powered services, creating AI copilots that sit alongside business users, or creating brand new workflows with gen AI at the core, we are excited to invest in the Cambrian explosion that this emerging AI infrastructure stack will unleash.\n\n### New AI infrastructure needs to enable enterprises to use multiple foundational models in concert\n\nRight now, companies can choose between leveraging three different types of AI models, each with their own trade-offs:\n\n*   **Closed models:** OpenAI’s GPT-4 and similar models are ideal for non-customized use cases. They’re cost-effective for rapid experimentation but have limitations on model control, security, and transparency.\n*   **Open models:**These models can be fine-tuned with industry-specific or proprietary data and augmented with RAG techniques to better suit a company’s specific needs. These models are the most cost-effective in production, and they reduce vendor lock-in, which increases control over future costs. \n*   **Proprietary models:** These are reserved for high-value, highly customized use cases. They are the most expensive and time-consuming to develop, but they offer a competitive edge through proprietary data and intellectual property control. \n\nUltimately, we believe that the most sophisticated enterprises will leverage tens if not hundreds of AI models simultaneously, including all three types of models outlined above. The companies that will succeed in this new AI world will be the ones that best match AI models to their specific use cases, and every software company will need the tooling to train, tune, and orchestrate all these models.\n\nTo this end, we are excited to [announce our investment](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/building-the-future-of-ai-together) in a company at the heart of this emerging AI infrastructure stack that directly addresses this need.

These pioneers combine AI with human expertise to deliver faster, better, and cheaper outcomes than legacy service providers. Take Mechanical Orchard – they're using AI to accomplish in months what traditionally takes years: moving mainframes to the cloud.\n\nWe [wrote about this emerging model](https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/the-death-of-deloitte-ai-enabled-services-are-opening-a-whole-new-market/) last year. Since then, we've seen an explosion of companies adopting it, many with compelling early traction. But here's the catch: founders are trying to force-fit traditional SaaS strategies onto these service-based businesses. There’s some key similarities, but also some critical differences.\n\nHaving invested in and studied this emerging space, we've identified 5 essential lessons for building an iconic AI-enabled service company. Consider this a contribution to the new playbook.\n\n‍\n\n### 1. Bring on a domain expert early – they are even more critical than before\n\nIn traditional SaaS, you're selling a product. In AI-enabled services, you're selling yourself. As such, domain credibility isn't just important - it's existential. Early customers need to believe in your ability to deliver results, and established credibility goes a long way towards building that trust. Domain authority also unlocks access to high-quality talent channels, which enables the rapid staffing that you may need while your AI is still maturing.\n\nThat said, technical leadership is equally vital to prevent over-reliance on manual services revenue. A domain expert paired with an applied AI expert makes for the ideal founding team – balancing credibility with a relentless push for automation.\n\n### 2. Beware Mirage PMF\n\nPMF is a different beast in AI-enabled services. Strong revenue growth and NDR can mask a lack of true AI enablement. We call it \"Mirage PMF\".\n\nReal PMF in AI-enabled services requires proving you can scale non-linearly relative to your costs. To get there, your AI must drive measurable improvements in cost, quality, or speed—or ideally, all three.\n\n![Image 1](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67d0b820a9e389b3a4bb52a1/682e334898e95beff2a76cfa_67d95b2de2e5c573c7ac956d_beware_mirage_PMF.png)\n\n### 3. Develop partnerships early on – they can be a key growth accelerator\n\nPartnerships with incumbents can be a major accelerant early on for AI-enabled services. Incumbents offer immediate market credibility, established distribution, and access to proprietary datasets, which can be crucial in the early days while your data corpus is small.\n\nTo take advantage of these benefits, service startups are exploring partnership models that go well beyond the traditional revenue-share approaches of SaaS. Some startups are exploring equity share relationships with incumbents, while others are fully acquiring existing service providers. Each of these approaches have pros/cons worth considering critically.\n\n### 4. Leverage new pricing models – they can help unlock higher contract values\n\nAI-enabled services come with different pricing models than classic SaaS. If used effectively, they can help you unlock higher contract values because you’re delivering both technology and labor. Two major models exist for how to price these contracts; you need to understand the benefits and risks of each:\n\n*   **Labor-Based**: Price based on the number of labor hours used to service the contract. This guarantees margin early on, but risks cannibalizing growth as automation increases.\n*   **Outcome-Based**: Price based on the value of final output delivered. This aligns incentives and scales margins long-term, but may hurt profitability in the early days when AI capabilities are still nascent.\n\nWe’ve found that it is generally best for AI-enabled service vendors to start with the market norm, which is typically a labor-based approach while they are learning how to efficiently deliver their service. At the same time, they should set clear timelines to transition to an outcome-based model.\n\nRegardless of pricing model however, founders should look for opportunities to embed recurring revenue so that they can continue to monetize clients even when their initial projects are completed. Palantir is the best example of this at scale. They deeply embed themselves in initial engagements with heavily customized software and then support that software via ongoing contracts.\n\n### 5. It’s the demo, stupid!\n\nIn SaaS, demos are used to showcase product value. It’s a tried and true method that works, particularly in an era where buyers are eager to see some AI magic 🪄\n\nIn AI-enabled services, the art of the demo has been forgotten. Instead, founders default to pitch decks and talk tracks. This is understandable since the AI product isn’t used directly by the customer; the service provider wields the magic internally to deliver their outcomes.\n\nBut it’s a huge mistake. Without a demo, it can be hard for a buyer to visualize what makes you different from every other service provider with a similar pitch. And if you’re a startup competing with established/trusted services brands, it’s even more critical to showcase your magic. Don’t hide it behind the curtain.\n\nIt can feel wasteful to build a customer facing demo for a product they’ll never directly use. But it’ll be the best GTM investment you’ll make. I’ve seen AI-enabled services companies halve their sales cycles just by adding in a demo.\n\nSo stop telling prospects about your AI. Show ‘em.\n\n![Image 2](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67d0b820a9e389b3a4bb52a1/682e334898e95beff2a76cf5_67d95b4e485722347820948a_its_the_demo_stupid.png)\n\nIf you’re exploring AI-enabled services, we’d love to learn alongside you.

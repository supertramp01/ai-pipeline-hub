Inc.** is an American [multinational corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation \"Multinational corporation\") and [technology company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company \"Technology company\") headquartered in [Cupertino, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California \"Cupertino, California\"), in [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley \"Silicon Valley\"). It is best known for its [consumer electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics \"Consumer electronics\"), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software \"Computer software\"), and [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_service \"Online service\"). Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs \"Steve Jobs\"), [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak \"Steve Wozniak\") and [Ronald Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne \"Ronald Wayne\"), the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the [largest technology company by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_technology_company_by_revenue \"Largest technology company by revenue\"), with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 [fiscal year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year \"Fiscal year\").\n\nThe company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's [Apple I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I \"Apple I\") personal computer. Its second computer, the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_(original) \"Apple II (original)\"), became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced [microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\"). Apple introduced the [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\") in 1983 and the [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K \"Macintosh 128K\") in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface \"Graphical user interface\") and a [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse \"Computer mouse\"). By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT \"NeXT\"), and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; [John Sculley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley \"John Sculley\") served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable [market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share \"Market share\") in the [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer \"Personal computer\") industry to the lower-priced [Wintel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel \"Wintel\") duopoly of the [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\")[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") on [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel \"Intel\")-powered [PC clones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible \"IBM PC compatible\"). In 1997, Apple was weeks away from [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy \"Bankruptcy\").

Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the [Apple Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\"). Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\n\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh \"Macintosh\") division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-TheVerge-33) Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-rice19850415-34)\n\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language \"Programming language\").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-IsProgramingObsolete-35) Its debut was signified by \"[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement) \"1984 (advertisement)\")\", a US$1.5 million television advertisement directed by [Ridley Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott \"Ridley Scott\") that aired during the third quarter of [Super Bowl XVIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XVIII \"Super Bowl XVIII\") on January 22, 1984.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-36) This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-37) and was called a \"masterpiece\" by [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN \"CNN\")[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-38) and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by _[TV Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV\\_Guide \"TV Guide\")_.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-39)\n\nThe advertisement created great interest in [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K \"Macintosh 128K\"), and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $3,000 in 2024). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,600 in 2024), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-40): 195  In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO [John Sculley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley \"John Sculley\"), who had been hired away from [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo \"PepsiCo\") two years earlier by Jobs[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-41) saying, \"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?\"[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-42) Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-43)\n\nThe board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products.

Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [profit margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin \"Profit margin\"), and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [power users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user \"Power user\") snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% [profit margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin \"Profit margin\") of the [Macintosh II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_II \"Macintosh II\").[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-insidestoryCarlton-52): 79–80\n\nThis policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on [IBM PC compatibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible \"IBM PC compatible\") with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products. The [Christmas season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_Christmas \"Economics of Christmas\") of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-insidestoryCarlton-52): 117–129  During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing [Michael Spindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spindler \"Michael Spindler\") as the [chief operating officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer \"Chief operating officer\").[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004184%E2%80%93185-53) Gassée left the company later that year to set up a rival, [Be Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Inc. \"Be Inc.\")[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004160-54)\n\n### 1990–1997: Decline and restructuring\n\n[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Apple_macintosh_lcII.jpg/250px-Apple_macintosh_lcII.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_macintosh_lcII.jpg)\n\nMacintosh [LC II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_II \"LC II\")\n\nThe company pivoted strategy and, in October 1990, introduced three lower-cost models: the [Macintosh Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Classic \"Macintosh Classic\"), the [Macintosh LC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC \"Macintosh LC\"), and the [Macintosh IIsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_IIsi \"Macintosh IIsi\"), all of which generated significant sales due to pent-up demand.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004128-55) In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful [PowerBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_100_series \"PowerBook 100 series\") with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [System 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7 \"System 7\"), a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.\n\nThe success of the lower-cost Macs and the PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-lemsculley-56) For some time, Apple was doing very well, introducing fresh new products at increasing profits. The magazine _[MacAddict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacAddict \"MacAddict\")_ named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the \"first golden age\" of the Macintosh.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-57)\n\n[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Apple_PenLite_prototype%2C_1992.jpg/250px-Apple_PenLite_prototype%2C_1992.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_PenLite_prototype,_1992.jpg)\n\nThe [PenLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PenLite \"PenLite\") is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform) \"Newton (platform)\").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-58)\n\nThe success of lower-cost consumer Macs, especially the LC, cannibalized higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, for different markets: the high-end [Quadra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Quadra \"Macintosh Quadra\") series, the mid-range [Centris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Centris \"Macintosh Centris\") series, and the consumer-marketed [Performa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performa \"Performa\") series. This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-vawperforma-59)\n\nIn 1993, the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II \"Apple II\") series was discontinued. It was expensive to produce, and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-60) The [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe \"Apple IIe\") was discontinued in 1993.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-61)\n\nApple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including [QuickTake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTake \"QuickTake\")[digital cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera \"Digital camera\"), [PowerCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerCD \"PowerCD\") portable CD audio players, [speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleDesign_Powered_Speakers \"AppleDesign Powered Speakers\"), the [Pippin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin \"Apple Pippin\") video game console, the [eWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWorld \"EWorld\") online service, and [Apple Interactive Television Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Interactive_Television_Box \"Apple Interactive Television Box\"). Enormous resources were invested in the problematic [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform) \"Newton (platform)\") tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-62)\n\nThroughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows \"Windows\") by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-63) Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa \"Apple Lisa\") in _[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple\\_Computer,\\_Inc.\\_v.\\_Microsoft\\_Corp. \"Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.\")_[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-lemms-64) The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed. The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by [Michael Spindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spindler \"Michael Spindler\").[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-65)\n\n[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/PowerMac_6100-66b.JPG/250px-PowerMac_6100-66b.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PowerMac_6100-66b.JPG)\n\nThe [Power Macintosh 6100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_6100 \"Power Macintosh 6100\"), introduced in 1994, was Apple's first new home computer model after the switch to [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC \"PowerPC\") processors.\n\nUnder Spindler, Apple, [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), and [Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola \"Motorola\") formed the [AIM alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_alliance \"AIM alliance\") in 1994 to create a new computing platform (the [PowerPC Reference Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_Reference_Platform \"PowerPC Reference Platform\") or PReP), with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the [Power Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh \"Power Macintosh\"), the first of many computers with Motorola's [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC \"PowerPC\") processor.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-66)\n\nIn the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build [Macintosh clones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_clone \"Macintosh clone\"). Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-FOOTNOTELinzmayer2004[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidmXnw5tM8QRwCpgPA254_254%E2%80%93256]-67)\n\nIn 1996, Spindler was replaced as CEO by [Gil Amelio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Amelio \"Gil Amelio\"), who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator. Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-68)\n\nThis period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system ([System 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_1 \"System 1\")) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this by introducing [cooperative multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking \"Cooperative multitasking\") in System 5, but still decided it needed a more modern approach.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-69) This led to the [Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent \"Taligent\") project in 1988, [A/UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/UX \"A/UX\") that same year, [Copland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system) \"Copland (operating system)\") in 1994, and evaluated the purchase of [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS \"BeOS\") in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive [Jean-Louis Gassée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Gass%C3%A9e \"Jean-Louis Gassée\"), demanded $300 million in contrast to Apple's $125 million offer.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-70) Only weeks away from [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy \"Bankruptcy\"),[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-71) Apple's board preferred [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP \"NeXTSTEP\") and purchased [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT \"NeXT\") in late 1996 for $400 million, retaining [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs \"Steve Jobs\").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-72)\n\n### 1997–2007: Return to profitability\n\nThe NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-archive-73) and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup, which resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup. Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Entrepreneur20111027-74)\n\nThe next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-75) This was seen as an \"antitrust insurance policy\" for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices in the _[United States v. Microsoft Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\_States\\_v.\\_Microsoft\\_Corp. \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\")_ case.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-76) Around then, Jobs donated Apple's internal library and archives to [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University \"Stanford University\"), to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-77)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-78) He ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, [Power Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Computing \"Power Computing\").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-79) On November 10, 1997, the [Apple Store website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store_(online) \"Apple Store (online)\") launched, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer [Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell \"Dell\")'s success.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-80) The moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company had a $309 million profit.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Entrepreneur20111027-74)\n\n[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/IMac_G3_Bondi_Blue%2C_three-quarters_view.png/250px-IMac_G3_Bondi_Blue%2C_three-quarters_view.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IMac_G3_Bondi_Blue,_three-quarters_view.png)\n\niMac\n\n[![Image 20](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Clamshell_iBook_G3.jpg/120px-Clamshell_iBook_G3.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clamshell_iBook_G3.jpg)\n\niBook\n\n[![Image 21](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Apple_Yosemite.JPG/250px-Apple_Yosemite.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Yosemite.JPG)\n\nPower Macintosh G3\n\n[![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Apple_PowerBook_G3_500_Pismo-2763.jpg/120px-Apple_PowerBook_G3_500_Pismo-2763.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_PowerBook_G3_500_Pismo-2763.jpg)\n\nPowerBook G3\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the [iMac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3 \"IMac G3\"). The iMac was a huge success, with 800,000 units sold in its first five months,[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-800kimacs-81) and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the [3+1⁄2-inch diskette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk \"Floppy disk\"), being an early adopter of the [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB \"USB\") connector, and coming pre-installed with Internet connectivity (the \"i\" in iMac)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Alyson_Raletz-82) via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by [Jonathan Ive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive \"Jonathan Ive\"), who had been hired by Amelio, and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple's product design.[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Time-83)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-84)\n\nA little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the [iBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook \"IBook\") consumer laptop. It culminated Jobs's strategy to produce only four products: refined versions of the [Power Macintosh G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3 \"Power Macintosh G3\") desktop and [PowerBook G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G3 \"PowerBook G3\") laptop for professionals, and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-85)\n\nAround then, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired [Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia \"Macromedia\")'s Key Grip digital video editing software project, which was launched as [Final Cut Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Pro \"Final Cut Pro\") in April 1999.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-86) Key Grip's development also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product [iMovie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMovie \"IMovie\") in October 1999.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Bell-87) Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the [DVD authoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_authoring \"DVD authoring\") software DVDirector, which Apple repackaged as the professional-oriented [DVD Studio Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_Studio_Pro \"DVD Studio Pro\"), and reused its technology to create [iDVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDVD \"IDVD\") for the consumer market.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Bell-87) In 2000, Apple purchased the [SoundJam MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundJam_MP \"SoundJam MP\") audio player software from [Casady & Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casady_%26_Greene \"Casady & Greene\"). Apple renamed the program [iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes \"ITunes\"), and simplified the user interface and added CD burning.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-88)\n\nIn 2001, Apple changed course with three announcements. First, on March 24, 2001, Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system, [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X \"Mac OS X\"). This was after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X is based on [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP \"NeXTSTEP\"), [OpenStep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStep \"OpenStep\"), and [BSD Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Unix \"BSD Unix\"), to combine the stability, reliability, and security of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface. Second, in May 2001, the first two [Apple Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store \"Apple Store\") retail locations opened in Virginia and California, offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-89)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-First_stores-90)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-MacRumors_stores-91) At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail, but they became highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-fortune-best-retailer-92)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-storelist-2) Third, on October 23, 2001, the [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod \"IPod\") portable digital audio player debuted. The product was first sold on November 10, 2001, and was extremely successful, with over 100 million units sold within six years.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-93)\n\n[![Image 23](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/ITunes_Store_Songs_Sales.jpg/250px-ITunes_Store_Songs_Sales.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ITunes_Store_Songs_Sales.jpg)\n\nThe iTunes Store was highly successful in shaping the legal [music downloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download \"Music download\") industry; chart shows the number of songs sold from 2003 to 2010.\n\nIn 2003, the [iTunes Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store \"ITunes Store\") was introduced with [music downloads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download \"Music download\") for 99¢ a song and iPod integration. It quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 5 billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-94) Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-95)\n\nIn 2002, Apple purchased [Nothing Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Real \"Nothing Real\") for its advanced digital [compositing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing \"Compositing\") application [Shake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_(software) \"Shake (software)\"),[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-96) and [Emagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emagic \"Emagic\") for the music productivity application [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro \"Logic Pro\"). The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company.

By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-printel-99) The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the [Mac Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Pro \"Mac Pro\"), [MacBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook \"MacBook\"), and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-100) Apple also introduced [Boot Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp_(software) \"Boot Camp (software)\") in 2006 to help users install [Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP \"Windows XP\") or [Windows Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista \"Windows Vista\") on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-101)\n\nApple's success during this period was evident in its [stock price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_price \"Stock price\").

The feature, called \"App Tracking Transparency\", received heavy criticism from [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\"), whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as [targeted advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising \"Targeted advertising\"). After Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in early 2021. A study by [Verizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon \"Verizon\") subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-233)\n\nPrior to the release of [iOS 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_15 \"IOS 15\"), Apple announced new efforts at combating [child sexual abuse material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material \"Child sexual abuse material\") on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor [iMessage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMessage \"IMessage\") users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function \"Hash function\") would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates. However, privacy advocates, including the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation \"Electronic Frontier Foundation\"), condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-234)\n\nIreland's [Data Protection Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Commission \"Data Protection Commission\") launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDPR \"GDPR\") law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-235)\n\nIn December 2019, security researcher [Brian Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Krebs \"Brian Krebs\") discovered that the [iPhone 11 Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11_Pro \"IPhone 11 Pro\") would still show the arrow indicator –signifying location services are being used– at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled, despite all individual location services being disabled. Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment, he was told by Apple that \"It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled. The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings.\"[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-236) Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with [ultra-wideband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-wideband \"Ultra-wideband\") regulations in specific countries, a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone 11 Pro, and emphasized that \"the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data.\" Will Strafach, an executive at security firm [Guardian Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Firewall \"Guardian Firewall\"), confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server. Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device's location.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-237)[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-238)\n\nAccording to published reports by [Bloomberg News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News \"Bloomberg News\") on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_addresses \"IP addresses\") to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents.

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [Fortune 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500 \"Fortune 500\") company. By the time of the \"[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(advertisement) \"1984 (advertisement)\")\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-260) According to a 2011 report in _[Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune\\_(magazine) \"Fortune (magazine)\")_, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Fortune1-261) In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching _[Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\\_Trek \"Star Trek\")_ and attending [_Star Trek_ conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_convention \"Star Trek convention\") in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-262)\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, some media have suggested that it has lost some of its original character.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-263)[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-264)[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-265)[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-266) Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned.[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-267) Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-cultofmacwork-268)\n\nThe Apple [Fellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow#Industry_and_corporate_fellows \"Fellow\") program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [personal computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computing \"Personal computing\").

For instance, [Ron Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Johnson_(businessman) \"Ron Johnson (businessman)\")—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Lashinsky2011-276) Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a \"directly responsible individual\" or \"DRI\" in Apple jargon.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Fortune1-261)[[273]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-277) Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-278)\n\nIn 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 [SEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission \"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\") filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-279) In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-280)\n\nApple has a strong culture of [corporate secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_secrecy \"Corporate secrecy\"), and has an anti-[leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_leak \"News leak\") Global Security team that recruits from the [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency \"National Security Agency\"), the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\"), and the [United States Secret Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service \"United States Secret Service\").[[277]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-281) In December 2017, [Glassdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassdoor \"Glassdoor\") said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-282) In 2023, _Bloomberg_'s[Mark Gurman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gurman_(journalist) \"Mark Gurman (journalist)\") revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch.

The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[[374]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-378) Greenpeace praised Apple's [sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_metrics_and_indices \"Sustainability metrics and indices\"), noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[[375]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-379) In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing [halogen-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_smoke_zero_halogen \"Low smoke zero halogen\")[USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB \"USB\") and power cables.[[376]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-380)\n\n### Green bonds\n\nIn February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5 billion [green bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_bond \"Green bond\") (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[[370]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Apple-environment-reports-374)[[377]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-381)\n\nSupply chain\n------------\n\nMain article: [Apple supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_supply_chain \"Apple supply chain\")\n\nApple products were made in the United States in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [outsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing \"Outsourcing\") initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by _The New York Times_, Apple insiders \"believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that '[Made in the U.S.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_the_USA \"Made in the USA\")' is no longer a viable option for most Apple products\".[[378]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-382)\n\nThe company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: \"Nobody wants to buy sour milk.\"[[379]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-supply-383)[[380]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-384)\n\nIn May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for \"advanced manufacturing\" in the United States,[[381]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-385) and subsequently invested $200 million in [Corning Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corning_Inc. \"Corning Inc.\"), a manufacturer of toughened [Gorilla Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Glass \"Gorilla Glass\") technology used in Apple's [iPhones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\").[[382]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-386) The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, [Jeff Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Williams_(Apple) \"Jeff Williams (Apple)\"), told _[CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC \"CNBC\")_ that the \"$1 billion\" amount was \"absolutely not\" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that \"We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology — and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that — that quite frankly is essential to our innovation.\"[[383]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-387)\n\nDuring the Mac's early history, Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[[384]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-388) This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [PCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect \"Peripheral Component Interconnect\") bus in the [7500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7500 \"Power Macintosh 7500\")/[8500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_8500 \"Power Macintosh 8500\")/[9500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_9500 \"Power Macintosh 9500\")[Power Macs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh \"Power Macintosh\").

[FireWire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireWire \"FireWire\") is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [IEEE 1394](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394 \"IEEE 1394\") and is a legally mandated port in all cable TV boxes in the United States.[[385]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-389)\n\nApple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO [Tim Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook \"Tim Cook\") said that he \"[loves] India\", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[[386]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-390) India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as \"really adds cost to getting product to market\".[[387]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-391) In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore \"Bangalore\") and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[[388]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-392) In March, _[The Wall Street Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Wall\\_Street\\_Journal \"The Wall Street Journal\")_ reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India \"over the next two months\",[[389]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-393) and in May, the _Journal_ wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of the [iPhone SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(1st_generation) \"IPhone SE (1st generation)\") in the country,[[390]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-394) while Apple told _[CNBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC \"CNBC\")_ that the manufacturing was for a \"small number\" of units.[[391]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-395) In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of the iPhone 7 at its [Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengaluru \"Bengaluru\") facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[[392]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-396) At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[[393]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-397) The opening of the Apple Store was postponed, and finally took place in April 2023,[[394]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-398) while the online store was launched in September 2020.[[395]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-399)\n\n### Worker organizations\n\nMain article: [Apple and unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_and_unions \"Apple and unions\")\n\nApple directly employs 147,000 workers including 25,000 corporate employees in [Apple Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park \"Apple Park\") and across Silicon Valley.[[396]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Downey2021-400)[[397]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-Leswing2021-401) The vast majority of its employees work at the over 500 retail [Apple Stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store \"Apple Store\") globally.[[398]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#cite_note-402) Apple relies on a larger, outsourced workforce for manufacturing, particularly in China where Apple directly employs 10,000 workers across its retail and corporate divisions.

Apple redefined and transformed the capabilities of modern computing. Further, Apple innovated the industry by establishing a marketplace ecosystem for third-party application developers, leveraging this new economy to expand its products’ functionalities and strengthen its position.

Wozniak had a lifelong dream of building his own personal computer.\n\nWozniak was inspired by the Altair 8800, the first commercially successful microcomputer launched in 1975. Further encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a hobbyist group, he quickly developed a simple gaming motherboard: his first personal computer.\n\n![Image 9: Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs holding an Apple I circuit board in 1976](https://cdn.britannica.com/02/24402-050-2C2345B1/Steven-Jobs-Apple-I-Stephen-Wozniak-circuit-1976.jpg?w=690)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\n In order to create their new company, both Wozniak and Jobs sold some of their possessions. For Wozniak, it was his HP programming calculator.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\n![Image 10: first Apple computer](https://cdn.britannica.com/03/24403-050-33ACE2DB/Apple-Computer-circuit-board-1976.jpg?w=690)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe first Apple computer.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\n![Image 11: The Apple II computer combined modern aesthetics with functionality](https://cdn.britannica.com/04/24404-050-0E38AF29/Apple-II.jpg?w=690)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe Apple II's motherboard had eight expansion slots, providing users with more flexibility when deciding what to add to the computer.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\nWozniak, then a 26-year-old engineering intern at [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.britannica.com/money/Hewlett-Packard-Company), presented his design to his employer. When the company expressed no interest, Wozniak teamed up with a former [high school](https://www.britannica.com/topic/high-school) classmate, 21-year-old Steve Jobs. The two decided to set up their operations in the Jobs family garage, founding Apple Inc. on April 1, 1976, along with Ronald Wayne, an experienced tech industry executive who would play a role in helping facilitate and integrate the young founders’ company vision and operational pursuits.\n\nJobs and Wozniak each held a 45% stake in the company; Wayne had a 10% partnership stake. To fund their venture with working capital, Jobs sold his Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak his programmable calculator.\n\nWith the help of its first [angel investor](https://www.britannica.com/money/venture-capitalist-angel-investing) and Intel Corporation veteran Armas Clifford “Mike” Markkula, the company unveiled its inaugural product, the Apple I, in July 1976 at a Homebrew Computer Club meeting. Selling for $666.66, the Apple I was a bare motherboard with a basic [CPU](https://www.britannica.com/technology/central-processing-unit), random access memory (RAM), and video capabilities, but no keyboard or monitor. Nevertheless, the company’s first product marked the garage start-up’s first success—however minor—selling 200 units that year. Later that year, Ronald Wayne decided to leave the fledgling company, selling back his 10% share for $800.\n\n1977–1978: Apple II and early commercial success\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn January 1977, with Markkula providing his expertise and seed funding of $250,000, Apple Inc. was [incorporated](https://www.britannica.com/money/types-of-business-structures).\n\n[Apple II](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Apple-II), the company’s next product, was released in April 1977 and became the first widely distributed microcomputer. It was a commercial success; some 5 or 6 million units were sold over the next decade.\n\nThis new iteration hinted at a slight design breakthrough with its custom-molded plastic casing, a departure from the steel-encased designs of the time. The Apple II also included color graphics, sound, and television plug-in capabilities. Selling for a base price of $1,298, it was perceived as a user-friendly product, contributing to its success among general consumers.\n\nHaving achieved its first milestone in the larger consumer market, the company boosted its competitive position when Wozniak introduced a disk controller enabling an affordable [floppy disk](https://www.britannica.com/technology/floppy-disk) drive. This inclusion enhanced Apple II’s data storage and retrieval, making it faster and more reliable.\n\n1979: Innovations—GUI, mice, and icons\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn 1979, Jobs led a team of engineers to see the innovations created at the [Xerox Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/Xerox-Corporation)’s [Palo Alto Research Center](https://www.britannica.com/topic/PARC-company) (PARC) in California.\n\n![Image 12: Apple's Lisa computer](https://cdn.britannica.com/05/24405-050-217BD4E9/Apple-Lisa-computer.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nApple's Lisa computer, introduced in 1983, featured a graphical user interface.\n\nCourtesy of Apple Computer, Inc.\n\nAt PARC, they were shown three features that would serve as the company’s game-changing innovations:\n\n*   The functional [graphical user interface](https://www.britannica.com/technology/graphical-user-interface) (GUI), featuring on-screen windows\n*   A pointing device known as a mouse\n*   The use of icons (pictographs) in place of awkward command line instructions\n\nThese features would be integrated into two key projects in development: the Apple Lisa (released in 1983) and the Apple Macintosh (1984). (Xerox would later sue Apple in 1989, claiming it stole the idea for its graphical user interface. The lawsuit was dismissed in 1990 on technical grounds, with the court saying Xerox chose the wrong venue to argue most of its legal points.)\n\nThe idea was to develop low-cost and user-friendly personal computers that would introduce the two innovative features—the GUI and mouse—to mass consumers. Although both computers sported these new features, they were designed to appeal to different audiences. The Lisa was geared toward business professionals, while the Macintosh targeted the broader consumer market.\n\n1980–1985: Competition from IBM, Macintosh, and Steve Jobs’ exit\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApple’s profits and size grew at a historic rate. By 1980 the company netted over $100 million and had more than 1,000 employees. In December 1980, Apple went public, offering 4.6 million shares at $22 each.\n\nApple’s [initial public offering](https://www.britannica.com/money/ipo-initial-public-offering) (IPO) was the biggest since 1956 when [Ford Motor Company](https://www.britannica.com/money/Ford-Motor-Company) went public. Further, by the end of 1980, Apple’s nearly $2 billion valuation was greater than Ford’s.\n\n**IBM enters the PC market.** As a formidable contender in the emerging PC market, Apple would soon face competition from [IBM](https://www.britannica.com/money/International-Business-Machines-Corporation), the computer industry’s leading player.\n\nIBM launched its own version of the personal computer in 1981, breaking with its tradition of using only proprietary hardware components and software. Instead, IBM built its PC using readily available components, including an [Intel](https://www.britannica.com/money/Intel) microprocessor and a [disk operating system](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MS-DOS) (DOS) from [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/Microsoft-Corporation).\n\nBecause other manufacturers could use the same hardware components that IBM used and license DOS from Microsoft, new software developers could count on a wide [IBM PC](https://www.britannica.com/technology/IBM-PC)–compatible market for their software. The system soon had a new [spreadsheet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/spreadsheet) program, Lotus 1-2-3, that changed computing and created what would later be known as a “killer app”: a software program (application) so useful that it propels hardware sales.\n\nIBM’s PC won instant support and popularity in the business community, and the Apple II was unable to dislodge IBM’s position. Flanked by its existing suite of business computing products, IBM’s new offering struck a fatal blow to the yet-to-be-released Apple Lisa.\n\nUpon its debut in 1983, the Lisa’s $9,995 price tag was more than five times the cost of an IBM PC. If cost alone didn’t guarantee its commercial underperformance compared to IBM, the Lisa also had numerous hardware issues and incompatibilities that made its performance sluggish compared to its competition.\n\nThe Lisa was an epic failure for the company’s foray into the business computing market. But Apple fared better in the general consumer market with the release the following year of a product that might even be considered iconic, culturally perhaps more so than functionally.\n\n**Apple launches the Macintosh.** Following its failed Lisa launch, Apple prepared for a second product release, hoping to gain a stronger, if not dominant, position in the market. The new product was the [Macintosh](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Macintosh) computer.\n\nAlthough Jef Raskin led the Macintosh research project as early as 1979, Steve Jobs took over the project in 1981, having been removed from the Lisa project due to collaborative tensions. Jobs’ intervention and contentious disagreements with Raskin on the project’s vision and direction prompted Raskin to leave the company in 1982.\n\nIntroduced to the world via television commercial during [Super Bowl](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Super-Bowl) XVIII on January 22, 1984, Apple immediately became a household name. The commercial, directed by [Ridley Scott](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ridley-Scott), struck a hard, albeit symbolic, blow against IBM, associating it with the dystopian and villainous authority of [George Orwell’s](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Orwell) novel _1984_.\n\nIn contrast, the ad portrayed Apple as the countercultural hero of the story—a symbol of freedom, progress, and innovation.\n\nThe Macintosh’s integration of a user-friendly GUI, all-in-one design, and affordable price of $2,500 made it accessible and appealing to businesses and technical users but also, and perhaps more importantly, to general consumers. Although the ad profoundly affected viewers, becoming one of the most iconic commercials in Super Bowl history, it generated more cultural buzz than commercial sales.\n\n1985–1997: Leadership struggles after Jobs and Wozniak\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite ecstatic media reaction, the Macintosh initially sold below Apple’s expectations. The Mac, as it came to be known, had insufficient memory and storage capacity. It lacked essential features like cursor keys and a color display, both of which were considered standard amenities for PCs at the time.\n\nFurthermore, skeptics doubted that adults would ever want to use a machine that relied on the GUI, condemning it as “toylike” and wasteful of computational resources.\n\nIn the wake of the poor sales performance, Jobs was ousted from the company in September 1985 by [chief executive officer](https://www.britannica.com/money/chief-executive-officer) (CEO) [John Sculley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Sculley). (Wozniak had left Apple in February 1985 to become a teacher.)\n\nUpon exiting Apple, Jobs founded another computer company, NeXT Inc., in 1985. The next year, he purchased Lucasfilm’s Computer Graphics Division to create [Pixar Animation Studios](https://www.britannica.com/money/Pixar-Animation-Studios). The founding of both companies, although outside the scope of Apple’s development at the time, would prove instrumental to the company’s forthcoming era of innovation in technology (NeXT’s technology was the foundation of macOS) as well as design and user experience (what is now called UX).\n\nUnder Sculley, Apple made steady improvements to the Mac—most notably, the introduction of an affordable laser printer along with Aldus Corporation’s PageMaker, the Mac’s first killer app (1985). Together, these two innovations launched the [desktop publishing](https://www.britannica.com/topic/desktop-publishing) revolution for consumers and businesses alike. The graphic arts and publishing industries quickly became the Mac’s single most important market.\n\nIn 1987, the Mac II and Mac SE were introduced. The Mac II was the first of the Mac line to incorporate color graphics and a modular design, while the Mac SE was the first of its series to offer an expansion slot (later including a hard drive bay as a standard feature).\n\nAlthough these products boosted Apple’s popularity among consumers, as evidenced by its growing base of one million users, the company would soon be mired in legal challenges that impeded its pace and progress.\n\n**Apple litigates while PCs innovate.** The Mac’s incompatibility with Apple II software, a problem the company initially ignored, slowed educational sales and compelled the company to retain its outmoded Apple II line through 1993, hampering its progress as an industry innovator.\n\nConsumer sales suffered as Apple discouraged game development out of fear that the Mac would not be taken seriously in the business community. Moreover, [Microsoft](https://www.britannica.com/money/Microsoft-Corporation), after an unsuccessful attempt to secure an agreement to market the [Mac OS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/macOS) on the Intel processor, introduced [Windows](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Microsoft-Windows), its own graphical [operating system](https://www.britannica.com/technology/operating-system).\n\nApple litigated for years, in vain, to stop Microsoft from copying the “look and feel” of its operating system, although the Mac OS itself drew upon Xerox’s PARC GUI. Meanwhile, as successive versions of Windows improved and competition among multiple [PC](https://www.britannica.com/technology/personal-computer) manufacturers led to greater innovation and lower prices, fewer consumers were willing to pay the premium Apple had commanded owing to its reputation for quality.\n\nAs the 1980s drew to a close, Apple would find itself facing a few more legal headwinds (including its legal battle with Xerox over the graphical user interface):\n\n*   In 1989, Apple Corps Ltd., the Beatles’ record label, sued Apple for trademark issues related to the company’s name and logo. The legal battle spanned several years; it escalated in the 2000s when Apple introduced [iTunes](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iTunes) and the [iPod](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPod), thereby entering the music industry.\n*   Also in 1989, Apple disposed of unsold Lisa units in a landfill in Logan, Utah. This event became part of tech lore, a symbol of the company’s biggest innovative flop. Meanwhile, Jobs released the NEXTSTEP operating system—a significant development, as it would later serve as the basis for Apple’s Mac OS X upon Jobs’ return to the company.\n\n**Apple-IBM rapprochement.** In a surprising move, Apple and [IBM](https://www.britannica.com/money/International-Business-Machines-Corporation) announced an alliance in 1991. In addition to signing a technology agreement with [Motorola, Inc.](https://www.britannica.com/money/Motorola-Inc) to develop a next-generation chip, known as the PowerPC, Apple and IBM created two new software companies to develop operating system software: Taligent, Inc., and Kaleida Labs, Inc.\n\nTaligent was expected to enable versions of both the Mac OS and the [IBM OS/2](https://www.britannica.com/technology/IBM-OS-2) to run on a new computer hardware standard, the common hardware reference platform (CHRP). Kaleida Labs was to develop multimedia software.\n\nBut as both companies began to quarrel over CHRP engineering specifications and costs mounted to about $400 million for Taligent and $200 million for Kaleida Labs, Apple pulled out with little to show for its investment.\n\n**Apple’s Newton and Claris flops.** Sculley also promised more than Apple could deliver with Newton, a personal digital assistant ([PDA](https://www.britannica.com/technology/PDA)) that suffered from poor handwriting recognition and diverted company engineering and financial resources.\n\nIn addition, the company vacillated over Claris Corporation, its software division, first reorganizing it as an independent company and then reabsorbing it when it began shifting more resources to Windows software.\n\n**Apple continues to flounder.** In 1993, Sculley was replaced by Michael Spindler as CEO. Spindler’s most notable achievements were the successful migration of the Mac OS to the PowerPC microprocessor and the initiation of a shift away from Apple’s proprietary standards.\n\nNevertheless, Apple struggled with marketing projections, accumulating large unsalable inventories of some models while simultaneously unable to meet a billion dollars in orders for other models.\n\nCombined with drastic quality control problems, notably a defective line of monitors and some highly publicized combustible portable computers, these failings brought Spindler’s reign to an end in early 1996 with the appointment of Gilbert F. Amelio.\n\n1997–2010: Renaissance and reinvention\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn 1996, Apple made a pivotal move that would profoundly affect its strategic direction. After several attempts to develop a replacement for its aging Mac operating system, Apple purchased NeXT Software, Inc., the company that Jobs had founded after being ousted from Apple in 1985.\n\nBuilding on this move, Apple, under Amelio’s leadership, began cutting operating costs and reestablishing quality controls. Despite these efforts, only a small percentage of new computer buyers were choosing Macs over Windows machines. Apple’s financial situation was dire toward the end of its second decade.\n\nJobs, now an advisor to Apple’s embattled CEO, quickly became disenchanted with the company’s direction, selling all but one share of the Apple stock he had received in the NeXT sale.\n\nWhen Apple failed to become profitable under Amelio and its worldwide market share fell to roughly 3%, the board of directors in mid-1997 recruited a surprising temporary replacement: Jobs, who for the first time became the undisputed leader of the company he cofounded.\n\n**The return of Jobs: iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.** Upon retaking the helm, Jobs immediately set about revitalizing the company, announcing an alliance with erstwhile foe Microsoft, ending the half-hearted (and profit-draining) program to license the Mac OS, streamlining the company’s multiple (and confusing) product lines, and launching the [iMac](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iMac), the first of many affordable and innovative products to come from the now-revitalized company.\n\n![Image 13: Steve Jobs](https://cdn.britannica.com/64/121664-004-73C27A0C/Steve-Jobs.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\n1998 photo of Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple (Apple Computer), which he co-founded in 1976.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nApple branded its products as part of an upscale lifestyle, or “iLife,” by emphasizing sleek, minimalist, and aesthetically pleasing designs (like the iMac) that looked more like [modern art](https://www.britannica.com/art/modern-art-to-1945-2080464) than machinery.\n\nDesigned to revive Apple’s consumer and educational appeal, the iMac quickly became the all-time best-selling Mac, lifting Apple’s U.S. market share to roughly 13.5% in August 1998 from a record low of 2.6% in December 1997. Moreover, Apple had a profitable [fiscal year](https://www.britannica.com/money/fiscal-year) in 1998, its first since 1995.\n\n![Image 14: Apple iMac](https://cdn.britannica.com/36/100736-050-A6E0FCBE/Participants-social-networking-sites-multimedia-files-type.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nApple marketed its products as part of an upscale lifestyle, or “iLife,” by emphasizing designs, such as the iMac, that took up less space and looked more like modern art than machinery.\n\n© Index Open\n\nIn 2001 Apple introduced [iTunes](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iTunes), a media player and library software to store, organize, and play digital audio files converted to [MP3](https://www.britannica.com/technology/MP3) format. Later the same year, Apple began selling the [iPod](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPod), a portable MP3 player, which quickly became the market leader. (The term _[podcast](https://www.britannica.com/art/podcast)_, combining _iPod_ and _broadcast_, is used as both a noun and a verb to refer to audio or video material downloaded for portable or delayed playback.) Later models added larger storage capacities or smaller sizes, color screens, and video playback features.\n\nIn 2003 Apple began selling downloadable copies of major record company songs in MP3 format over the [Internet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet). The iPod Nano digital music player, one-fifth the size of the original iPod, was introduced by Apple in 2005. By 2006 more than one billion songs and videos had been sold through Apple’s [website](https://www.britannica.com/technology/website).\n\nIn 2007 Apple introduced the touch screen [iPhone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPhone), a [cellular telephone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/mobile-telephone#ref279849) with capabilities for playing MP3s and videos and accessing the Internet. More than just a mobile computer and media player merged with a phone, it pioneered multi-touch features that shaped the way users interact with technology.\n\n![Image 15: iPod Nano](https://cdn.britannica.com/57/90457-050-6AD457F3/iPod-Nano-music-player-size-Apple-Computer.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe iPod Nano digital music player, one-fifth the size of the original iPod, was introduced by Apple in 2005.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nAlthough the iPhone was designed for the broader consumer market, one of its biggest competitors—[BlackBerry](https://www.britannica.com/technology/BlackBerry-wireless-device), designed by the Canadian company Research in Motion (RIM)—was the dominant mobile communications device among business users.\n\n![Image 16: iPhone](https://cdn.britannica.com/94/102994-050-184833AC/telephone-addition-iPhone-Web-browser-Internet-content-2007.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nApple's touch screen iPhone, released in 2007.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nIn response, Apple sought to dislodge RIM’s position in 2007–2009 by differentiating the iPhone and innovating mobile functionalities that changed consumers’ needs and expectations, including:\n\n*   Multi-touch screen functionalities that allowed users to swipe, pinch (zoom), and type on a digital keyboard. This was a significant departure from RIM’s products, which had physical keys. \n*   Combining text and email—the functionalities the BlackBerry specialized in—with phone, Internet browsing, and iPod capabilities. \n*   Compatibility with Mac computers, giving the iPhone integrative capabilities that far exceeded those of the BlackBerry. \n*   Upgrading the iPhone in 2008 to make it compatible with 3G wireless networks and retrofitting it with [global positioning system (GPS)](https://www.britannica.com/technology/GPS) capabilities. \n*   Creating an ecosystem of third-party apps (Apple’s App Store) that accelerated the iPhone’s extended capabilities beyond devices, like the BlackBerry, that relied on in-house development.\n\nApple’s dual focus on consumer needs and business integration, positioning the iPhone as a daily extension of home and work life, eventually gained market share from RIM.\n\nBy June 19, 2009, when Apple released the [iPhone 3GS](https://www.britannica.com/topic/iPhone-3GS) (which sold one million units in the first three days), the company’s share of the [smartphone](https://www.britannica.com/technology/smartphone) market had reached about 20% (compared with about 55% for the BlackBerry line of smartphones).\n\nIn addition to hardware changes such as a three-megapixel [digital camera](https://www.britannica.com/technology/digital-camera) that could record digital videos and an internal digital compass capable of working with various mapping software, the iPhone 3GS included a new operating system, the iPhone OS 3.0.\n\nThe new system included support for voice-activated controls and peer-to-peer ([P2P](https://www.britannica.com/technology/P2P)) play of [electronic games](https://www.britannica.com/topic/electronic-game) with other iPhone users over [Wi-Fi](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Wi-Fi) Internet connections. The latter feature was part of Apple’s strategy to compete in the portable gaming market with the [Nintendo Company](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Nintendo-console)’s DS and the [Sony Corporation](https://www.britannica.com/money/Sony)’s PSP. The iPhone can also be used for reading electronic books, or e-books. E-books in iPhone-compatible formats can be purchased over the Internet from [electronic book](https://www.britannica.com/technology/e-book) dealers such as the iTunes store and [Amazon.com](https://www.britannica.com/money/Amazoncom).\n\nIn 2010 Apple unveiled the [iPad](https://www.britannica.com/technology/iPad), a touch screen device whose size and function bridged the gap between a [laptop computer](https://www.britannica.com/technology/laptop-computer) and a smartphone. The iPad was a multimedia tablet that allowed users to operate it with the same set of finger gestures as the iPhone. Designed with a touch screen capable of displaying high-definition video, the iPad also provided access to apps via iTunes and the App Store.\n\n![Image 17: iPad](https://cdn.britannica.com/89/136089-050-BFA56CE2/iPad-2010.jpg?w=385)\n\nOpen full sized image\n\nThe iPad was released in 2010.\n\nCourtesy of Apple\n\nIn 2011 Apple introduced [iCloud](https://www.britannica.com/topic/iCloud), a [cloud computing](https://www.britannica.com/technology/cloud-computing) service in which a user’s applications, photographs, documents, calendars, and recently purchased music would be stored on iCloud servers and automatically updated on a user’s devices. Some analysts saw iCloud as Apple’s plan for a future in which users could dispense with the personal computer as the primary place to store data.\n\n[![Image 18: Britannica Money Logo](https://cdn.britannica.com/money/assets/Money-475x60-footer-2x.png?h=47&w=390)](https://www.britannica.com/money)\n\n[About Us](https://www.britannica.com/money/about)[Privacy Policy](https://corporate.britannica.com/privacy-policy-2)[Terms & Conditions](https://corporate.britannica.com/termsofuse.html)\n\n© 2025 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\n"

A 250,000-square-foot server manufacturing facility, slated to open in 2026, will create thousands of jobs.\n\nPreviously manufactured outside the U.S., the servers that will soon be assembled in Houston play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence, and are the foundation of Private Cloud Compute, which combines powerful AI processing with the most advanced security architecture ever deployed at scale for AI cloud computing. The servers bring together years of R&D by Apple engineers, and deliver the industry-leading security and performance of Apple silicon to the data center.\n\nTeams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers — which already run on 100 percent renewable energy. As Apple brings Apple Intelligence to customers across the U.S., it also plans to continue expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\n**Doubling Apple’s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund**\n\nAs part of this new investment, Apple is doubling its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which was created in 2017 to support world-class innovation and high-skilled manufacturing jobs across America. The growing commitment will increase the fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, focused on promoting advanced manufacturing and skills development throughout the country.\n\nThe fund’s expansion includes a multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon in TSMC’s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States. Mass production of Apple chips began last month.\n\nSilicon used by Apple is designed to bring Apple users incredible features, performance, and power efficiency across their devices. Apple’s suppliers already manufacture silicon in 24 factories across 12 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah. The company’s investments in the sector help create thousands of high-paying jobs across the country at U.S. companies like Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Skyworks, and Qorvo.\n\nTo date, Apple’s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund has supported projects in 13 states — including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Indiana — that have helped build local businesses, train workers, and create a wide range of innovative manufacturing processes and materials for Apple products.\n\n**Growing R&D Investments Across the U.S.**\n\nApple continues to expand its R&D across the U.S. In the past five years, Apple has nearly doubled its U.S.-based advanced R&D spend, and it will continue to accelerate its growth.\n\nRecently, Apple announced the newest addition to its iPhone lineup, iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1 — the first cellular modem designed by Apple, and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone. Apple C1 adds a new chapter to the story of Apple silicon and is the result of years of R&D investment, bringing together the work of thousands of engineers. Apple C1 is the start of a long-term strategy that will allow Apple to innovate and optimize the modem system for additional Apple products.\n\nIn the next four years, Apple plans to hire around 20,000 people, of which the vast majority will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning. The expanded commitment includes significant investment in Apple’s R&D hubs across the country. This includes growing teams across the U.S. focused on areas including custom silicon, hardware engineering, software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\n**Supporting American Businesses with a New Manufacturing Academy in Detroit**\n\nTo help companies transition to advanced manufacturing, Apple will open the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. Apple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State, will consult with small- and medium-sized businesses on implementing AI and smart manufacturing techniques. The academy will also offer free in-person and online courses, with a skills development curriculum that teaches workers vital skills like project management and manufacturing process optimization. The courses will help drive productivity, efficiency, and quality in companies’ supply chains.\n\nApple has long been committed to investing in education and skills development for American workers and students. That includes ongoing and expanding grant programs for organizations like 4-H, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and FIRST, which work closely with Apple in communities across the country to create free programming that helps young people learn vital skills like coding.\n\nApple’s support for the next generation of innovators also includes efforts like the company’s New Silicon Initiative, which prepares students for careers in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. Last year, this program expanded to students at Georgia Tech, and it now reaches students at eight schools across the country. Apple is continuing to expand the initiative, including a new collaboration with UCLA’s Center for Education of Microchip Designers (CEMiD) beginning this year.\n\n**About Apple** Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

1: TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 2, 2016: Detail from Apple shop in Tokyo, Japan. Apple is American multinational corporation founded at 1976 at Cupertino, California.](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AdobeStock_283599314_Editorial_Use_Only-300x200.jpeg)Apple has committed to spend over $500 billion in the U.S. by 2029, equalling the total that OpenAI and partners announced last month as part of the [Stargate Project](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/). From an R&D perspective, one core takeaway is how much of this cash will fuel cutting-edge work. For instance, Apple is specifically aiming to invest in artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and skills development for students and workers.\n\nWhile [a WSJ piece](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apples-500-billion-is-mostly-already-in-the-books-7cc7123e?mod=hp_lead_pos9) highlights the difficulty in ascertaining how much of the spending is actually new, given its history of spending about $1.1 trillion over the course of the past four fiscal years on operating expenses and capital outlays, half a trillion can buy a lot of R&D.The press release highlights the upcoming iPhone 16e and the Apple C1 cellular modem, indirectly addressing 5G. As Apple faces questions about its potential to innovate nearly two decades after the launch of its iconic iPhone in 2007, the new investment also allows Apple to adjust its business in a quickly moving technological landscape while minimizing [looming tariff threats](https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-responds-to-tariff-threat-with-500-billion-us-manufacturing-pledge#:~:text=Apple%20has%20announced%20plans%20to,and%20create%2020%2C000%20new%20jobs).\n\nApple will also collaborate with thousands of U.S. suppliers and partners, fueling research and development across sectors like chip design, telecommunications, and manufacturing. For an R&D-focused audience, Apple’s massive investment portends accelerated development of new technologies, robust funding for innovation programs, and expanded opportunities for engineers and researchers in the coming years.\n\nIn the afternoon of February 24, its stock was up 1%, trading at about $248.\n\nA domestic advanced manufacturing reboot\n----------------------------------------\n\nA centerpiece of Apple’s plan is the expansion of advanced manufacturing capabilities on U.S. soil. Notably, Apple will open a new 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas by 2026, dedicated to building AI-driven server hardware. Until now, Apple’s data center servers were largely built overseas; the new Houston plant will bring this infrastructure closer to home, enabling Apple to assemble the specialized servers that power its AI and cloud services domestically. These servers – part of what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence,” which also refers to a series of new features across the iPhone and other products, will also span its private cloud compute need. This move not only marks an expansion in manufacturing capacity, but also the integration of AI in production. The facility itself will produce AI-oriented hardware. In addition, Apple said it will double its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion to drive high-tech manufacturing projects. This fund, established to create high-skilled manufacturing jobs, has previously driven innovations like new laser and materials technologies. With the additional funding, Apple plans to support more cutting-edge manufacturing processes – for example, it will allocate multiple billions toward producing Apple silicon chips at TSMC’s Arizona fab (Fab 21).\n\nApple’s manufacturing expansion includes building out infrastructure and talent pipelines nationwide. The company also announced that it would debut a Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, Michigan. The academy will serve as a hub for workforce development and smart manufacturing training. This academy, in partnership with experts from top universities, will consult with small and mid-sized manufacturers on implementing AI-driven and advanced manufacturing techniques. In addition, it will offer free courses on project management and process optimization. The aim of the initiative is to elevate the skills of the manufacturing workforce.\n\nApple continues to grow its existing U.S. operations. It is planning investments in a string of states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina and Washington. A new $1 billion campus in Austin, TX is also underway, and data center expansions either planned or ongoing in many of these states.\n\nSilicon engineering plans shift AI server production from China\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApple plans to add thousands of engineers in chip design, software development, AI, and machine learning as part of its 20,000 new U.S. hires, according to [PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-responds-to-tariff-threat-with-500-billion-us-manufacturing-pledge#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20in%20the%20next%20four,development%2C%20AI%2C%20and%20machine%20learning). Apple underscores the Apple C1 modem in the upcoming iPhone 16e as a key element of these R&D efforts, which [could hint at plans to reduce its reliance on traditional partners like Qualcomm](https://www.rdworldonline.com/iphone-se-4-launch-hints-at-apples-long-game-in-5g-modems-challenging-qualcomms-reign/).\n\nApple is moving AI server production from China to a new Foxconn-operated facility in Houston—powered by Apple’s M-series chips with built-in encryption—to reduce supply-chain risks and boost data security, according to [Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman](https://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/apple-says-it-will-add-20-000-jobs-spend-500-billion-produce-ai-servers-in-us). By building its own private cloud infrastructure for AI, Apple can train large-scale machine learning models for Siri, on-device intelligence, and future generative AI features—while ensuring end-to-end control over hardware and software, consistent with its emphasis on user privacy.\n\nSupply chain and economic influence\n-----------------------------------\n\nApple’s $500 billion investment will bolster its network of thousands of U.S. suppliers. The company said the move will stimulate job creation in areas like chip engineering, advanced manufacturing, and 5G. By doubling its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion and partnering with suppliers such as Foxconn in Texas and TSMC in Arizona, Apple is driving domestic factory expansions, construction projects, and technology R&D. Apple alone will add 20,000 new U.S. jobs across R&D hubs, data centers, and the Houston server plant, while indirectly supporting thousands more in its supply chain. Collectively, this expansion strengthens regional economies and reinforces Apple’s already significant domestic footprint.\n\nAs Apple expands its data center capacity and opens its new manufacturing facility in Houston, the company is touting energy efficiency. The company announced in a statement that its forthcoming Houston-assembled servers are “designed to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers.” Finally, Apple reiterates that its data centers “already run on 100 percent renewable energy.”\n\n#### Related Articles [Read More >](https://www.rdworldonline.com/topics/airobotics/)\n\n[![Image 2](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250522_1734_Razor-and-GenAI-Blades_simple_compose_01jvx8yt8pe09ry390wnye486j-copy-268x170.webp)](https://www.rdworldonline.com/will-consumer-ai-hardware-be-the-next-rd-battlefield/)\n##### [Will consumer AI hardware be the next R&D battlefield?](https://www.rdworldonline.com/will-consumer-ai-hardware-be-the-next-rd-battlefield/)\n\n[![Image 3: Detailed view of a PCR testing kit for SARS-CoV-2 with an epidemiologist in protective gear analyzing samples to detect specific viral areas causing COVID-19 pneumonia --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6.1 Job ID: 7e698e8b-3ac0-4058-9c69-cb803819f39e](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AdobeStock_926241962-268x170.jpeg)](https://www.rdworldonline.com/when-data-goes-missing-how-poor-data-management-can-undermining-research-reproducibility/)\n##### [When data goes missing: How poor data management can undermining research reproducibility](https://www.rdworldonline.com/when-data-goes-missing-how-poor-data-management-can-undermining-research-reproducibility/)\n\n[![Image 4](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/portrait-268x170.jpg)](https://www.rdworldonline.com/openai-spends-6-5-billion-on-jony-ive-founded-startup-io/)\n##### [OpenAI spends $6.5 billion on Jony Ive-founded startup io](https://www.rdworldonline.com/openai-spends-6-5-billion-on-jony-ive-founded-startup-io/)\n\n[![Image 5: H100 image from NVIDIA](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/h100-og-268x170.jpg)](https://www.rdworldonline.com/after-reportedly-pursuing-shanghai-rd-site-nvidia-calls-u-s-gpu-export-controls-a-failure/)\n##### [After reportedly pursuing Shanghai R&D site, Nvidia calls U.S. GPU export controls a ‘failure’](https://www.rdworldonline.com/after-reportedly-pursuing-shanghai-rd-site-nvidia-calls-u-s-gpu-export-controls-a-failure/)\n\n[![Image 6: rd newsletter](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RDWorld-300x100-1.jpg)](https://www.rdworldonline.com/enews-sign-up/)\n\n EXPAND YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND STAY CONNECTED \n\n Get the latest info on technologies, trends, and strategies in Research & Development. \n\n[GET THE ENEWSLETTER](https://www.rdworldonline.com/enews-sign-up/)\n\n[![Image 7: RD 25 Power Index](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RD-House-Promo.jpg)](https://index.rdworldonline.com/)\n\n#### R&D World Digital Issues\n\n[![Image 8: Fall 2024 issue](https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rdworld-fall24-coverifinal.jpg)](https://www.rdworldonline.com/topics/digital-issues/)\n[Browse the most current issue](https://www.rdworldonline.com/topics/digital-issues/) of R&D World and back issues in an easy to use high quality format.

      "content": "Apple execs are, of course, acutely aware of its dependence on both the iPhone and its suppliers. Indeed, in recent years the company has made a number of significant investments in its own tech. It now makes its own chips, ending a decades-long reliance on third-parties like Intel, and it’s spending more on Research & Development — some $30 billion last year.

This [year’s event](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24232248/apple-event-september-iphone-16-date-time-live-stream-watch-how-to-rumors), which kicks off at 1 p.m. ET, has been dubbed “It’s Glowtime,” and the latest iPhone will be the headline act.\n\nFor those who haven’t been counting, we're now onto the ***iPhone 16*** — which is expected to be the first to include “Apple Intelligence.” The list of supporting characters in the show will include new AirPods, a range of new watches, a new iOS, and [more](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/what-to-expect-from-apples-september-9-iphone-event/). But, like so many Apple events before, it's really all about the phone.\n\nIf the prospect of a *slightly* better iPhone, with a *slightly* better camera, that is *slightly* more expensive than you want it to be doesn’t have you jumping up with excitement, rest assured you’re not alone. Consumers are [holding onto their phones longer](https://sherwood.news/tech/apple-iphone-longevity-by-design/): in 2015 just **6%** of iOS users reported having their phone for 3+ years, a figure that had soared to **31%** this year, per data from CIRP. And with every passing year, hype for the latest iPhone seems to diminish.\n\n![Apple iPhone Searches](https://sherwoodnews.imgix.net/apple-1.png)\n![Apple iPhone Searches](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nApple is hoping that its new suite of AI software, which it's calling “Apple Intelligence” will be a crowd-pleaser in a year that has gone [mad for AI](https://sherwood.news/business/a-startup-with-10-employees-is-now-worth-usd5-billion/). Apple Intelligence will only be available on newer iPhones, so Apple is betting the addition of AI will force some upgrades. And, after the disappointing release of Apple’s latest bold vision for the future of technology earlier this year — the **Vision Pro**, sales of which have reportedly fallen off a cliff per [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-u-s-sales-2000469302) — Apple could really use a win for its flagship product.\n\nBut just *how* important is the iPhone to Apple?\n\nFrom a financial perspective, despite the company’s success in diversifying into other revenue streams, the smartphone is still the mass that holds the Apple universe together. Last year, it accounted for **52%** of the company’s $383 billion in sales.\n\n![iPhone revenue](https://sherwoodnews.imgix.net/apple-2.png)\n![iPhone revenue](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nTechnically, that share has come down over the years: back in 2015, the iPhone was even more critical to the brand, accounting for nearly 70% of revenue. However, it’s difficult to imagine the rest of the Apple ecosystem flourishing without it. How many people buy an Apple Watch that don’t actually have an iPhone? Or AirPods? They certainly wouldn’t be getting much use out of the App Store without one. There are exceptions of course, but for the most part the iPhone remains the gateway to many of Apple’s products. And once you’re living your life within what’s known as Apple’s “Walled Garden” of products and systems, it [can get pretty hard to leave](https://sherwood.news/tech/apples-ecosystem-lock-in-isnt-innovation/), per Rani Molla.\n\n## **The next, next big thing**\n\nFor a long time the iPhone-maker relied heavily on its suppliers, its clever “Designed by Apple in California” phrasing skirting the fact that much of the actual hardware was made in countries like China, India, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\n\nApple execs are, of course, acutely aware of its dependence on both the iPhone and its suppliers. Indeed, in recent years the company has made a number of significant investments in its own tech. It now makes its [own chips](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/01/how-apple-makes-its-own-chips-for-iphone-and-mac-edging-out-intel.html), ending a decades-long reliance on third-parties like Intel, and it’s spending more on Research & Development — some **$30 billion** last year. Interestingly, that’s not just more in *absolute* dollars, but also as a *proportion* of its revenue, reversing a roughly 10-year spell when the company cut its R&D budget in relative terms.\n\n![Apple R&D](https://sherwoodnews.imgix.net/apple-3.png)\n![Apple R&D](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\nAll told, Apple has spent **$113 billion** on R&D in just the last 5 years. What do you get for that kind of bill? A [now-scrapped](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/27/1234315814/apple-cancels-electric-car) car project, some fairly routine upgrades of your product suite, a $3,500 VR headset, and potentially some [home robotics no one asked for](https://sherwood.news/business/apple-robotics-tabletop-home-device-next-project/). Perhaps whatever Apple announces on Monday will make it all worthwhile.\n\nInterestingly, despite the uptick, Apple still spent more than double its R&D budget on share buybacks last year, some $77 billion — a fact that the Department of Justice cites as an example of Apple’s anti-competitive conduct in [*The United States of America vs. Apple, Inc*](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/UNITED_STATES_et_al_v_APPLE_INC__njdce-24-04055__0001.0.pdf).\n\n### More Tech\n\n![Slate Auto CEO Chris Barman](https://sherwoodnews.imgix.net/mwphzyq69oso/en-US/assets/files/Chris-Barman-Slate-Auto.JPG)\n![Slate Auto CEO Chris Barman](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n## Slate Auto CEO Chris Barman tells us how exactly it’s making a $25,000 EV\n\nThe automotive veteran explains why her company can deliver a cheap electric vehicle when others, like Tesla, have failed.\n\n![tech](https://sherwoodnews.imgix.net/vertical-icons/tech-100x100.png)\n![tech](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\n\n## Tesla has applied to test robotaxis in Arizona, but not California\n\nEarlier this week, [Tesla](https://robinhood.com/us/en/stocks/TSLA/?source=sherwood) CEO Elon Musk [said](https://sherwood.news/tech/tesla-to-expand-robotaxi-service-area-in-austin-this-weekend-and-to-the-bay/) the company’s nascent robotaxi service would be expanding to the Bay Area “in a month or two,” but was notably light on the details. So far, the EV company has yet to apply for testing permits in California, Reuters reports, citing a statement from the California Public Utilities Commission.

Musk also highlighted Grok 4’s new high score in the [challenging ARC-AGI 2 benchmark](https://sherwood.news/tech/openais-arc-de-triumph/).\n\nTwo versions of the model were announced: Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy.

This initiative will expand Apple’s facilities and workforce while advancing innovation in artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and manufacturing. As part of the plan, Apple will hire 20,000 new employees, with a significant focus on research and development.\n\nA key aspect of the investment includes the construction of a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, which will produce servers supporting Apple Intelligence. Slated to open in 2026, this facility will create thousands of jobs and strengthen Apple’s infrastructure for AI cloud computing. Additionally, Apple is doubling its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with a major portion allocated to producing advanced silicon at TSMC’s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. The company’s silicon production already spans 24 factories across 12 states.\n\nApple’s research and development efforts will continue to grow, with an emphasis on AI, custom silicon, and software engineering. Over the past five years, the company has nearly doubled its U.S.-based R&D spending, and this new investment will further accelerate progress in these areas. To support workforce development, Apple is launching the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, where engineers and university experts will help small and medium-sized businesses implement AI and smart manufacturing technologies. The academy will also provide free courses focused on project management and process optimization.\n\nApple’s investment will impact multiple states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. The initiative underscores Apple’s commitment to strengthening American manufacturing, job creation, and technological innovation.\n\n Source: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/)\n\n### Share This Story\n\n[](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/99084-apple-announces-historic-500-billion-us-investment-to-expand-manufacturing-ai-and-r-and-d)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/99084-apple-announces-historic-500-billion-us-investment-to-expand-manufacturing-ai-and-r-and-d&text=Apple%20Announces%20Historic%20%24500%20Billion%20U.S.%20Investment%20to%20Expand%20Manufacturing%2C%20AI%2C%20and%20R%26amp%3BD)\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/99084-apple-announces-historic-500-billion-us-investment-to-expand-manufacturing-ai-and-r-and-d)\n\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/99084-apple-announces-historic-500-billion-us-investment-to-expand-manufacturing-ai-and-r-and-d)\n\n[](https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/99084-apple-announces-historic-500-billion-us-investment-to-expand-manufacturing-ai-and-r-and-d#)\n\n[](https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/print/99084-apple-announces-historic-500-billion-us-investment-to-expand-manufacturing-ai-and-r-and-d)\n\n**Looking for a reprint of this article?\n\n From high-res PDFs to custom plaques, [order your copy today](https://www.bnpmedia.com/reprints?oly_enc_id=)!**\n\n[![Image 2: Jennifer pierce](https://www.assemblymag.com/ext/resources/Contact_Us/Jennifer-Pierce.jpg?height=96&t=1708105621&width=96)](https://www.assemblymag.com/authors/2302-jennifer-pierce)\n\nJennifer Pierce, ASSEMBLY Magazine\n\nRecommended Content\n===================\n\n[JOIN TODAY](https://bnp.dragonforms.com/init.do?pk=X_W_WRCONREC&returnurl=https://www.assemblymag.com/user/omeda?referer=https://www.assemblymag.com/&omedasite=Assembly_Create)\n\nTo unlock your recommendations.\n\n**Already have an account?**[Sign In](https://bnp.dragonforms.com/init.do?pk=X_W_WRSIGN&returnurl=https://www.assemblymag.com/user/omeda?referer=https://www.assemblymag.com/&omedasite=Assembly_Login)\n\n*   [![Image 3: Made in the U.S.A.](https://www.assemblymag.com/ext/resources/Issues/2023/july/hero1440x750.jpg?height=740&t=1689854593&width=auto)](https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/97886-consumer-products-manufacturing-made-in-the-usa)[Consumer Products Manufacturing: Made in the USA](https://www.assemblymag.com/articles/97886-consumer-products-manufacturing-made-in-the-usa)\n==============================================================================================================================================\n\nSupply chain lessons learned during the coronavirus...

Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington \"Redmond, Washington\").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-2) Founded in 1975, the company became influential in the [rise of personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers#The_early_1980s_and_home_computers \"History of personal computers\") through software like [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows \"Windows\"), and the company has since expanded to [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\") services, [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing \"Cloud computing\"), [video gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_gaming \"Video gaming\") and other fields. Microsoft is the [largest software maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_software_companies \"List of the largest software companies\"), one of the [most valuable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion-dollar_company \"Trillion-dollar company\") public U.S. companies,[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-3) and one of the [most valuable brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_valuable_brands \"List of most valuable brands\") globally.\n\nMicrosoft was founded by [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") and [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\") to develop and sell [BASIC interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_interpreter \"BASIC interpreter\") for the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800 \"Altair 8800\"). It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS \"MS-DOS\") in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS \"MS-DOS\") with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering \"Initial public offering\") (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. [Steve Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer \"Steve Ballmer\") replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. He oversaw the then-largest of [Microsoft's corporate acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft \"List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\") in [Skype Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_Technologies \"Skype Technologies\") in 2011,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-4) and an increased focus on hardware[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-5)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-6) that led to its first in-house PC line, the [Surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface \"Microsoft Surface\"), in 2012, and the formation of [Microsoft Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mobile \"Microsoft Mobile\") through [Nokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia \"Nokia\"). Since [Satya Nadella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella \"Satya Nadella\") took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing \"Cloud computing\"),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-7)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-8) as well as its large acquisition of [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn \"LinkedIn\") for $26.2 billion in 2016.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-9) Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox \"Xbox\") brand, establishing the [Microsoft Gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Gaming \"Microsoft Gaming\") division in 2022 and [acquiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Activision_Blizzard_by_Microsoft \"Acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft\")[Activision Blizzard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard \"Activision Blizzard\") for $68.7 billion in 2023.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-10)\n\nMicrosoft has been market-dominant in the [IBM PC–compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC%E2%80%93compatible \"IBM PC–compatible\") operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_operating_systems \"List of Microsoft operating systems\") and the [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office \"Microsoft Office\") and [Microsoft 365](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365 \"Microsoft 365\") suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the [Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word \"Microsoft Word\") word processor, [Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel \"Microsoft Excel\") spreadsheet editor, and the [PowerPoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint \"Microsoft PowerPoint\") presentation program. Its flagship [hardware products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_hardware \"List of Microsoft hardware\") are the Surface lineup of personal computers and [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox \"Xbox\") video game consoles, the latter of which includes the [Xbox network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_network \"Xbox network\"); the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as [Bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing \"Microsoft Bing\") web search, the [MSN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN \"MSN\") web portal, the [Outlook.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com \"Outlook.com\") ([Hotmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotmail \"Hotmail\")) email service and the [Microsoft Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Store \"Microsoft Store\"). In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the [Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure \"Microsoft Azure\")[cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing \"Cloud computing\") platform, [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server \"Microsoft SQL Server\") database software, and [Visual Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio \"Visual Studio\").[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\n\nMicrosoft is considered one of the [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech \"Big Tech\") American [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\") companies, alongside [Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc. \"Alphabet Inc.\"),[[b]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-11)[Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company) \"Amazon (company)\"), [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\"), and [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms \"Meta Platforms\").[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-12) In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar [market cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization \"Market capitalization\"), becoming the third public U.S. company to be [valued at over $1 trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillion-dollar_company \"Trillion-dollar company\"). It [has been criticized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft \"Criticism of Microsoft\") for its monopolistic practices, and [the company's software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Microsoft_software \"List of Microsoft software\") has been criticized for problems with [ease of use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_use \"Ease of use\"), [robustness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science) \"Robustness (computer science)\"), and [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security \"Computer security\").\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nMain article: [History of Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft \"History of Microsoft\")\n\nFor a chronological guide, see [Timeline of Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Microsoft \"Timeline of Microsoft\").\n\n### 1972–1985: Founding\n\n[![Image 13](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg/330px-Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg)\n\nAn Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch\n\n[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/1981BillPaul.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1981BillPaul.jpg)\n\n[Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\") and [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-Allan_2001-13): 228 \n\n[![Image 15](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Bill_Gates_and_Paul_Allen_Business_Cards.jpg/250px-Bill_Gates_and_Paul_Allen_Business_Cards.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bill_Gates_and_Paul_Allen_Business_Cards.jpg)\n\nBill Gates and Paul Allen's Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center\n\nChildhood friends [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") and [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\") sought to make a business using their skills in [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming \"Computer programming\").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-14) In 1972, they founded [Traf-O-Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traf-O-Data \"Traf-O-Data\"), which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University \"Harvard University\") while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at [Washington State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_University \"Washington State University\"), though he later dropped out to work at [Honeywell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell \"Honeywell\").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-15)\n\nThe January 1975 issue of _[Popular Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular\\_Electronics \"Popular Electronics\")_ featured [Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Instrumentation_and_Telemetry_Systems \"Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems\")'s (MITS) [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800 \"Altair 8800\") microcomputer,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-16) which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC \"BASIC\") interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in [Albuquerque, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque, New Mexico\"). MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as [Altair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC \"Altair BASIC\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-Allan_2001-13): 108, 112–114  Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-BBCTL-17) and Allen suggested the name \"Micro-Soft\", short for micro-computer software.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-18)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-19) In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of [ASCII Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_Corporation \"ASCII Corporation\").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-20) Microsoft moved its headquarters to [Bellevue, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington \"Bellevue, Washington\"), in January 1979.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-BBCTL-17)\n\nMicrosoft entered the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\") (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") called [Xenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix \"Xenix\"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-21) but it was [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS \"MS-DOS\") that solidified the company's dominance. [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M \"CP/M\") OS to be used in the [IBM Personal Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer \"IBM Personal Computer\") (IBM PC).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-22) For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called [86-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86-DOS \"86-DOS\") from [Seattle Computer Products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Computer_Products \"Seattle Computer Products\") which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to [IBM PC DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS \"IBM PC DOS\"). Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS \"BIOS\"), so other companies had to reverse engineer it for non-IBM hardware to run as [IBM PC compatibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible \"IBM PC compatible\"), but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-23)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-24): 210  The company expanded into new markets with the release of the [Microsoft Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mouse \"Microsoft Mouse\") in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named [Microsoft Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Press \"Microsoft Press\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-Allan_2001-13): 232  Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing [Hodgkin's lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma \"Hodgkin's lymphoma\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-25) Allen claimed in _Idea Man: A Memoir by the co-founder of Microsoft_ that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-26) Allen later invested in [low-tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_technology \"Low technology\") sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-27)\n\n### 1985–1994: Windows and Office\n\n[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Microsoft_Windows_1.0_pages2_3.jpg/250px-Microsoft_Windows_1.0_pages2_3.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Microsoft_Windows_1.0_pages2_3.jpg)\n\n[Windows 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0 \"Windows 1.0\") was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line.\n\nMicrosoft released [Windows 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0 \"Windows 1.0\") on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS \"MS-DOS\"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-Allan_2001-13): 242–243, 246  despite having begun jointly developing [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2 \"OS/2\") with IBM that August.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-28) Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to [Redmond, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington \"Redmond, Washington\"), on February 26, 1986, and went public with an [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering \"Initial public offering\") (IPO) at the NASDAQ exchange on March 13,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-CBSCHRON-29) with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-30) Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-Allan_2001-13) In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-31): 243–244  Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT \"Windows NT\"), which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code.

Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft layoff ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession \"Great Recession\") of 2008–2017.[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-238)[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-239) In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered.

Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the [Fourth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the [United States Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice \"United States Department of Justice\") (DoJ). The DoJ had \"changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information.\"\n\nIn 2022 Microsoft shared a $9 billion contract from the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense \"United States Department of Defense\") for cloud computing with Amazon, Google, and Oracle.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-262)\n\n### Security challenges\n\nOn a Friday afternoon in January 2024, Microsoft disclosed that a Russian state-sponsored group hacked into its corporate systems.

Frequently criticized are the [ease of use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_use \"Ease of use\"), [robustness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science) \"Robustness (computer science)\"), and [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security \"Computer security\") of the company's software. They have also been criticized for the use of [permatemp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp \"Permatemp\") employees (employees employed for years as \"temporary\", and therefore without medical benefits), the use of [forced retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_retention \"Forced retention\") tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-329) Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to [burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout \"Occupational burnout\") within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a \"Velvet Sweatshop\", a term which originated in a 1989 _[Seattle Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle\\_Times \"Seattle Times\")_ article,[[324]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-330) and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.[[325]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-331) This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.\n\nAs reported by several news outlets,[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-332)[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-Neate-333) an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland \"Republic of Ireland\") declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in [Bermuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda \"Bermuda\") as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide.

As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of \"nearly 0%\". When the [Internal Revenue Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service \"Internal Revenue Service\") audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-334)[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-335) In 2023, Microsoft reported in a securities filing that the U.S. [Internal Revenue Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service \"Internal Revenue Service\") was alleging that the company owed the U.S. $28.9 billion in past taxes, plus penalties related to mis-allocation of corporate profits over a decade.[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-336)\n\n\"Embrace, extend, and extinguish\" (EEE),[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-DeadlyEmbrace-337) also known as \"embrace, extend, and exterminate,\"[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-338) is a phrase that the [U.S. Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice \"United States Department of Justice\") found[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-339) that was used internally by Microsoft[[334]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-340) to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software \"Proprietary software\") capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in \"Vendor lock-in\").\n\nMicrosoft was the first company to participate in [the PRISM surveillance program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) \"PRISM (surveillance program)\"), according to leaked NSA documents obtained by _The Guardian_[[335]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-341) and _The Washington Post_[[336]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-342) in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak.[[337]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-343) The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant.

In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors.[[339]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-345)\n\nIn 2020, [Salesforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce \"Salesforce\"), the manufacturer of the [Slack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software) \"Slack (software)\") platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation.[[340]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-346)\n\nIn June 2024, Microsoft Corp. faced a potential EU fine after regulators accused it of abusing market power by bundling its Teams video-conferencing app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software. The European Commission issued a statement of objections, alleging Microsoft's practice since 2019 gave Teams an unfair market advantage and limited interoperability with competing software. Despite Microsoft's efforts to avoid deeper scrutiny, including unbundling Teams, regulators remained unconvinced. This action followed a 2019 complaint from Slack, which was later acquired by Salesforce. Microsoft's Teams usage soared during the pandemic, growing from 2 million daily users in 2017 to 300 million in 2023. The company has a history of antitrust battles in the U.S. and Europe, with over €2 billion in EU fines previously imposed for similar abuses.[[341]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-347)\n\nIn October 2024, Microsoft fired two employees, software engineers Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawal,[[342]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-348) who organized an unauthorized vigil at its Redmond headquarters to honor Palestinians killed in the [Gaza war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war \"Gaza war\"). The employees, part of the group \"No Azure for Apartheid,\" sought to address the company's involvement in the Israeli government's use of its technology.[[343]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-349) On 20 March 2025, before an event at Seattle's Great Hall with Brad Smith and Steve Ballmer, protestors projected \"Microsoft powers [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide \"Gaza genocide\")\" on the wall. Subsequently, two employees interrupted AI executive Mustafa Suleyman at a speaking event on 4 April 2025 in protest at the company's support of Israel.[[344]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-350) The [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions \"Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions\") movement added Microsoft to its list of targets for partnering \"with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system\".[[345]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-351)In February 2025, the Associated Press reported that the Israeli military was utilizing Microsoft-developed artificial intelligence tools in its military and intelligence operations against the people of Gaza. In May 2025, Microsoft issued an unsigned statement confirming that these services had been made available to Israel. However, no evidence has yet been found to indicate that these tools were employed during the massacre of the people of Gaza.[[346]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-352)\n\nIn November 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into Microsoft, focusing on potential antitrust violations related to its cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity businesses. The probe scrutinized Microsoft's bundling of cloud services with products like Office and security tools, as well as its growing AI presence through its partnership with OpenAI. This inquiry is part of broader efforts by the U.S. government to curb the power of major tech companies, especially under FTC chair Lina Khan. Concerns were raised about Microsoft's licensing practices potentially locking customers into its services and its AI investments possibly sidestepping regulatory oversight.[[347]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-353)\n\nIn June 2025 Microsoft recently helped suspend the email account of an International Criminal Court prosecutor in the Netherlands who was investigating Israel for war crimes in order to comply with a Trump executive order.[[348]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-354)[[349]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_note-355)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n*   [List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft \"List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\")\n*   [Microsoft engineering groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_engineering_groups \"Microsoft engineering groups\")\n*   [Microsoft Enterprise Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Enterprise_Agreement \"Microsoft Enterprise Agreement\")\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-3)**After Apple and Amazon, respectively\n2.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-11)**Parent company of Google\n3.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-12)**Parent company of Facebook\n4.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-200)**After Apple and Amazon, respectively\n5.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-247)**\n\n    *   [Game Workers Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Workers_Alliance \"Game Workers Alliance\") ([Raven Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_Software \"Raven Software\"))\n    *   Game Workers Alliance Albany\n    *   Activision Quality Assurance United-CWA\n    *   ZeniMax Workers United/CWA\n    *   OneBGS ([Bethesda Game Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios \"Bethesda Game Studios\"))\n    *   World of Warcraft\n    *   Texas Blizzard QA United-CWA\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#cite_ref-1)**[\"Microsoft Corporation Form 10-K\"](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000789019/000095017024087843/msft-20240630.htm).

Headquartered in [Redmond](/place/Redmond-Washington), Washington, Microsoft initially gained dominance in the [operating systems](/technology/operating-system) market during the 1980s and ’90s with MS-DOS and [Windows](/technology/Microsoft-Windows). Its strong market position eventually gave rise to the company’s diverse and extensive range of technological offerings, from [personal computing](/technology/personal-computer) and entertainment to [enterprise](/money/business-organization) [cloud computing](/technology/cloud-computing) and [artificial intelligence](/technology/artificial-intelligence).\n\nMicrosoft operates research labs in Cambridge, England (1997); Beijing (1998); Bengaluru, India (2005); Cambridge, Massachusetts (2008); [New York](/place/New-York-state), New York (2012); and Montreal (2015). Microsoft’s operations can be divided into three major business segments: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. Each segment consists of several products and services.\n\n## Productivity and business processes\n\n**Microsoft Office Suite** includes the mainstay [Word](/technology/Microsoft-Word), [Excel](/technology/Microsoft-Excel), and [PowerPoint](/technology/Microsoft-PowerPoint) applications and can be further divided into commercial and consumer categories:\n\n![Technician operates the system console on the new UNIVAC 1100/83 computer at the Fleet Analysis Center, Corona Annex, Naval Weapons Station, Seal Beach, CA.

Universal Automatic Computer](https://cdn.britannica.com/93/149293-131-2CD523EA/Technician-computer-system-console-UNIVAC-Corona-Annex-June-1-1981.jpg)\n\n**[LinkedIn](/money/LinkedIn)** is a business-oriented [social media](/topic/social-media) platform with services including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.\n\n**Microsoft Dynamics** is a suite of intelligent and cloud-based applications designed to assist in various business operations, including finance, marketing, sales, [supply chain management](/money/what-is-supply-chain-management), and customer service.\n\n## Intelligent cloud\n\n**Azure Cloud Services** is Microsoft’s flagship cloud computing platform; it offers hundreds of cloud-based products and services. The second-largest cloud service in the world, Azure held roughly 23 percent of global market [share](/money/stock-finance) for the cloud in 2023, second only to [Amazon Web Services](/money/Amazoncom#ref371214) (AWS).\n\nOther intelligent cloud services include [SQL](/technology/SQL) Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and [GitHub](/technology/GitHub).\n\n## **What do you think?**\n\n**Explore the ProCon debate**\n\n## More personal computing\n\n**[Windows](/technology/Microsoft-Windows) Operating System** has gradually become a cornerstone of Microsoft’s success since its launch in the 1980s.\n\n**[Xbox](/technology/Xbox) gaming console** and various gaming subscriptions, such as Xbox Game Pass, have positioned Microsoft as a formidable player in the gaming industry.\n\n**Surface devices** are Microsoft’s touchscreen-based hardware, including laptops, tablets, and interactive whiteboards. Other products in this category include HoloLens and other PC accessories.\n\n## Founding and early growth\n\nIn 1975 [Bill Gates](/money/Bill-Gates) and [Paul G. Allen](/money/Paul-Allen), two boyhood friends from [Seattle](/place/Seattle-Washington), converted [BASIC](/technology/BASIC), a popular mainframe [computer programming language](/technology/computer-programming-language), for use on an early [personal computer](/technology/personal-computer) (PC), the Altair. Shortly afterward, Gates and Allen founded Microsoft, deriving the name from the words *microcomputer* and *software*. During the next few years, they refined BASIC and developed other [programming languages](/technology/computer-programming-language).\n\n![IBM Personal Computer](https://cdn.britannica.com/08/23608-004-47D6DC21/IBM-Personal-Computer-machine-Microsoft-MS-DOS-operating-1981.jpg?w=385)\n\n**The world runs on DOS.** In 1980, [International Business Machines Corporation](/money/International-Business-Machines-Corporation) (IBM) asked Microsoft to produce the essential [software](/technology/software), or [operating system](/technology/operating-system), for its first [personal computer](/technology/personal-computer), the IBM PC. Microsoft purchased an operating system from another company, modified it, and renamed it [MS-DOS](/technology/MS-DOS) (Microsoft Disk Operating System). MS-DOS was released with the IBM PC in 1981. Thereafter, most manufacturers of personal computers licensed MS-DOS as their operating system, generating vast revenues for Microsoft; by the early 1990s, it had sold more than 100 million copies of the program and defeated rival operating systems such as CP/M, which it displaced in the early 1980s, and later [IBM OS/2](/technology/IBM-OS-2).\n\n**The Windows revolution.** Microsoft deepened its position in operating systems with [Windows](/technology/Microsoft-Windows), a [graphical user interface](/technology/graphical-user-interface) whose third version, released in 1990, gained a wide following. By 1993, Windows 3.0 and its subsequent versions were selling at a rate of one million copies per month, and nearly 90 percent of the world’s PCs ran on a Microsoft operating system. In 1995 the company released Windows 95, which for the first time fully integrated MS-DOS with Windows and effectively matched in ease of use [Apple Computer](/money/Apple-Inc)’s [Mac OS](/technology/macOS).\n\n**Powering the office.** Microsoft also became the leader in productivity software such as [word processing](/technology/word-processing) and [spreadsheet](/technology/spreadsheet) programs, outdistancing longtime rivals Lotus and WordPerfect in the process.\n\n**Entering the media world.** Microsoft dramatically expanded its electronic publishing division, created in 1985 and already notable for the success of its multimedia encyclopedia, *[Encarta](/topic/Encarta)*. It also entered the information services and entertainment industries with a wide range of products and services, most notably the Microsoft Network and [MSNBC](/money/MSNBC) (a [joint venture](/money/joint-venture) with the [National Broadcasting Company](/money/National-Broadcasting-Co-Inc), a major American television network, which began in 1995 and ended in 2012).\n\n## The price of success: Regulatory scrutiny\n\nBy the mid-1990s Microsoft, which [became a publicly owned corporation](/money/ipo-initial-public-offering) in 1986, had become one of the most powerful [brands](/money/brand) and [profitable](/money/earnings-per-share-quarterly-earnings) companies in American history. It consistently earned profits of 25 cents on every sales dollar, an astonishing record. In the company’s 1996 [fiscal year](/money/fiscal-year), it topped $2 billion in [net income](/money/profit) for the first time, and its unbroken string of profits continued, even during the [Great Recession](/money/great-recession) of 2007–09 (its net income had grown to more than $14 billion by fiscal year 2009).\n\nIts rapid growth in a fiercely competitive and fast-changing industry, however, spawned resentment and jealousy among rivals, some of whom complained that the company’s practices violated U.S. laws against unfair competition. Microsoft and its defenders countered that, far from stifling competition and technical innovation, its rise had encouraged both and that its software had consistently become less expensive and more useful. A [U.S. Justice Department](/topic/US-Department-of-Justice) investigation concluded in 1994 with a settlement in which Microsoft changed some sales practices that the government contended enabled the company to unfairly discourage Windows customers from trying alternative programs. The following year the Justice Department successfully challenged Microsoft’s proposed purchase of [Intuit Inc.](/money/Intuit-Inc), then the leading maker of financial software for PCs.\n\n## Chasing the Internet and a return of regulatory woes\n\nPartly because of its stunning success in PC software, Microsoft was slow to realize the commercial possibilities of network systems and the [Internet](/technology/Internet). In 1993 it released Windows NT, a landmark program that tied disparate PCs together and offered improved reliability and network security. Sales were initially disappointing, but by 1996 Windows NT was being hailed as the likely standard for PC networking, quickly surpassing Novell’s NetWare in market share.\n\nMicrosoft did not move into Internet software until a new venture, [Netscape Communications Corp.](/money/Netscape-Communications-Corp), had introduced Navigator, a Web [browser](/technology/browser) that simplified the once-arcane process of navigating the [World Wide Web](/topic/World-Wide-Web). In a violent change of course, Microsoft quickly developed its own browser, [Internet Explorer](/technology/Internet-Explorer), made it free, and moved aggressively to persuade computer makers and Internet service providers to distribute it exclusively. By 1996 Microsoft was bundling Explorer with Windows OS and had begun the process of integrating Explorer directly into Windows. In response, Netscape accused Microsoft of violating its 1995 consent decree and sued; those efforts helped to persuade the Justice Department to reopen a broad investigation of Microsoft.\n\nIn 1999, following a trial that lasted 30 months, a judge found Microsoft in violation of the [Sherman Antitrust Act](/event/Sherman-Antitrust-Act) (1890) and ordered the breakup of the company. In 2001 an appeals court overturned the breakup order but still found the company guilty of illegally trying to maintain a [monopoly](/money/monopoly-economics). The company’s legal woes continued in 2004: The [European Union](/topic/European-Union) (EU) levied the largest fine in the organization’s history to that point, €497.2 million ($611 million), in retaliation for what were described as Microsoft’s near-monopoly practices. In February 2008 the EU imposed an even higher fine, €899 million ($1.35 billion), on the company for having defied the EU’s 2004 antitrust decision against Microsoft for illegally bundling multimedia software with its Windows operating system to the exclusion of competitors.\n\n## Entry into the gaming and mobile phone markets\n\nIn 2001 Microsoft released the [Xbox](/technology/Xbox), an [electronic game](/topic/electronic-game) console that quickly captured second place in the video gaming market. In 2002 it launched [Xbox Live](/topic/Xbox-Live), a broadband gaming network for its consoles. A more powerful gaming console, the [Xbox 360](/technology/Xbox-360), was released in 2005. In an intensely competitive market, where the Xbox faced strong pressure from the [Nintendo Wii](/topic/Nintendo-Wii) and [Sony](/money/Sony) [PlayStation](/topic/PlayStation), Microsoft struggled through the years to make consistent profits from its console. For example, in 2009 the company cut the price of the Xbox 360 Elite by as much as 25 percent in order to pick up market share. The move was successful; by 2010 the Xbox 360 was the most-used game console in the American home. But at the same time, the price cuts also led to a 6 percent drop in revenue in Microsoft’s Entertainment and Devices Division (EDD). The Xbox 360 was succeeded in 2013 by the Xbox One, which in turn was replaced by Xbox Series [X](/money/Twitter) and Xbox Series S in 2020.\n\n![Xbox 360 at the Tokyo Game Show](https://cdn.britannica.com/59/90459-050-2293BA10/Microsoft-video-game-machine-demonstration-units-Xbox-2005.jpg?w=385)\n\nOther EDD products also struggled. The Zune family of portable media players introduced in 2006 failed to challenge the market dominance of Apple’s [iPod](/technology/iPod), and it was discontinued in 2011. The Windows Mobile OS, used in [smartphones](/technology/smartphone) made by a variety of vendors, including HTC, LG, [Motorola](/money/Motorola-Inc), and [Samsung](/money/Samsung-Electronics), trailed in market share in the [United States](/place/United-States) behind Research in Motion’s [BlackBerry](/technology/BlackBerry-wireless-device) and Apple’s [iPhone](/technology/iPhone). In 2009 Microsoft ceased publishing online and disc versions of its *[Encarta](/topic/Encarta)* encyclopedia.\n\n![Britannica Money Logo](https://cdn.britannica.com/money/assets/Money-475x60-footer-2x.png?h=47&w=390)"

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\") and [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\") in [Albuquerque, New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque, New Mexico\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-founding-1) Its current best-selling products are the [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows \"Microsoft Windows\")[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\"); [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office \"Microsoft Office\"), a suite of productivity software; [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox \"Xbox\"), a line of entertainment of games, music, and video; [Bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_(search_engine) \"Bing (search engine)\"), a line of search engines; and [Microsoft Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure \"Microsoft Azure\"), a cloud services platform.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-MSFT-20190130-2)\n\nIn 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2 \"OS/2\"). Microsoft produced that operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.\n\nAs of June 30, 2015, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of US$86.83 billion (~$109 billion in 2023) and 128,076 employees worldwide.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-2014Revenue-3) It develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software \"Computer software\") products for computing devices.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-2005annual-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-fastfacts-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-2007financials-6)\n\n1975–1985: The founding of Microsoft\n------------------------------------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Microsoft&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: 1975–1985: The founding of Microsoft\")]\n\n[![Image 7](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg/250px-Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Altair_8800_and_Model_33_ASR_Teletype.jpg)\n\n[Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800 \"Altair 8800\") computer with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch.\n\nIn late 1974, [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\"), a programmer at [Honeywell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell \"Honeywell\"), was walking through [Harvard Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Square \"Harvard Square\") when he saw the cover of the January 1975 issue of _[Popular Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular\\_Electronics \"Popular Electronics\")_ that demonstrated the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800 \"Altair 8800\"), the first [microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) Allen bought the magazine and rushed to [Currier House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currier_House_(Harvard_College) \"Currier House (Harvard College)\") at [Harvard College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College \"Harvard College\"), where he showed it to high school friend [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) They saw potential to develop an implementation of [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC \"BASIC\") for the system.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-9)\n\nGates called Altair manufacturer [Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Instrumentation_and_Telemetry_Systems \"Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems\") (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter with the help of [Monte Davidoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Davidoff \"Monte Davidoff\"). When Allen flew to [Albuquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico \"Albuquerque, New Mexico\") to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute [Altair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC \"Altair BASIC\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) Allen moved to Albuquerque, Gates soon quit Harvard to join him, and they co-founded Microsoft there.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) Revenues of the company totalled $16,005 by the end of 1976.\n\n[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Microsoft-Staff-1978.jpg/250px-Microsoft-Staff-1978.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Microsoft-Staff-1978.jpg)\n\nMicrosoft staff in Albuquerque, December 7, 1978\n\nTop: [Steve Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Wood_(entrepreneur)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Steve Wood (entrepreneur) (page does not exist)\"), [Bob Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Wallace_(computer_scientist) \"Bob Wallace (computer scientist)\"), [Jim Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Lane_(Microsoft)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Jim Lane (Microsoft) (page does not exist)\")\n\nMiddle: [Bob O'Rear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_O%27Rear \"Bob O'Rear\"), [Bob Greenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Greenberg_(programmer)&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Bob Greenberg (programmer) (page does not exist)\"), [Marc McDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_McDonald \"Marc McDonald\"), [Gordon Letwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Letwin \"Gordon Letwin\")\n\nBottom: [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\"), Andrea Lewis, [Marla Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marla_Wood&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Marla Wood (page does not exist)\"), [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen \"Paul Allen\")\n\nNot pictured: [Ric Weiland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Weiland \"Ric Weiland\"), [Miriam Lubow](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Miriam_Lubow&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Miriam Lubow (page does not exist)\")[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Allen2011-11)\n\nAllen came up with the original name of _Micro-Soft_, a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau \"Portmanteau\") of [microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\") and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software \"Software\").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-12) Hyphenated in its early incarnations, on November 26, 1976, the company was registered under that name with the Secretary of State of New Mexico. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator [Ric Weiland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Weiland \"Ric Weiland\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10) The company's first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, entitled \"[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_(company) \"ASCII (company)\") Microsoft\" (now called \"[Microsoft Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Japan \"Microsoft Japan\")\"), and on November 29, 1979, the term, \"Microsoft\" was first used by Bill Gates.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) On January 1, 1979, the company moved from Albuquerque to a new home in [Bellevue, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington \"Bellevue, Washington\"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) since it was hard to recruit top programmers to Albuquerque.

The company restructured on June 25, 1981, to become an incorporated business in its home state of Washington (with a further change of its name to \"Microsoft Corporation, Inc.\"). As part of the restructuring, Bill Gates became president of the company and chairman of the board, and Paul Allen became executive vice president and vice chairman.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) In 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a [Hodgkin lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin_lymphoma \"Hodgkin lymphoma\") diagnosis, though he remained on the board as vice-chairman. This effectively ended the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-before_microsoft-14) Later in the decade, Gates and Allen repaired their relationship and together the two donated millions to their childhood school [Lakeside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeside_School_(Seattle) \"Lakeside School (Seattle)\").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-leibovich20001231-8) They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Gates_Mourns_Allen-15)\n\nMicrosoft's early products were different variants of [Microsoft BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC \"Microsoft BASIC\") which was the dominant programming language in late 1970s and early 1980s home computers such as [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II \"Apple II\") ([Applesoft BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC \"Applesoft BASIC\")) and [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64 \"Commodore 64\") ([Commodore BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC \"Commodore BASIC\")), and were also provided with early versions of the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC \"IBM PC\") as the [IBM Cassette BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Cassette_BASIC \"IBM Cassette BASIC\").\n\nMicrosoft also marketed through an Apple dealer in West Palm Beach, Florida two products for the Radio-Shack TRS-80. One was \"Typing Tutor\" which led the user through learning to use a keyboard. The other was authored by a professor at the University of Hawaii called \"MuMATH\" and had the ability to do mathematics in long integer math to avoid floating point numbers.\n\n[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Microsoft_Softcard_Z80_coprocessor_for_Apple_II.jpg/250px-Microsoft_Softcard_Z80_coprocessor_for_Apple_II.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Microsoft_Softcard_Z80_coprocessor_for_Apple_II.jpg)\n\nThe [Z-80 SoftCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-80_SoftCard \"Z-80 SoftCard\"), released in 1980\n\nThe first hardware product[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-lock19800506-16) was the [Z-80 SoftCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-80_SoftCard \"Z-80 SoftCard\") which enabled the Apple II to run the [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M \"CP/M\")[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system \"Operating system\"), at the time an industry-standard operating system for running business software and many [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler \"Compiler\") and [interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) \"Interpreter (computing)\") for several [high-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_language \"High-level language\") on [microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\"). The SoftCard was first demonstrated publicly at the [West Coast Computer Faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Computer_Faire \"West Coast Computer Faire\") in March 1980.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Infoworld_Apr_1980-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-Infoworld_Nov_1980-18) It was an immediate success; 5,000 cards, a large number given the microcomputer market at the time, were purchased in the initial three months at $349 (~$1,084 in 2023) each and it was Microsoft's number one revenue source in 1980.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-19)\n\nThe first operating system publicly released by the company was a variant of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") announced on August 25, 1980. Acquired from [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T \"AT&T\") through a distribution license, Microsoft dubbed it [Xenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix \"Xenix\"), and hired [Santa Cruz Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Operation \"Santa Cruz Operation\") in order to port/adapt the operating system to several platforms.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-xenix1-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-21) This Unix variant would become home to the first version of Microsoft's [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor \"Word processor\"), [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Word \"Microsoft Office Word\"). Originally titled \"Multi-Tool Word\", Microsoft Word became notable for its use of \"What You See Is What You Get\", or [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG \"WYSIWYG\") pioneered by the [Xerox Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto \"Xerox Alto\") and the [Bravo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(software) \"Bravo (software)\") text editor in the 1970s.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-22)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-23)\n\nSkeptics questioned the system software vendor's decision to produce application software. Gates said that doing so was not what _InfoWorld_ phrased as a \"big-time operation\", but Microsoft spent aggressively, with a reportedly \"unlimited\" R&D budget despite others in the industry advising against overexpansion.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-caruso19840402-24) Word was first released in the spring of 1983, and free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of [PC World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World \"PC World\"), making it one of the first programs to be distributed on-disk with a magazine. (Earlier magazine on-disk distributions included Robert Uiterwyk's BASIC in the May 1977 issue of Information Age.)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-SWTPC-Uiterwyk-25)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-RoyAllen-26) However, Xenix was never sold to end users directly although it was licensed to many software [OEMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer \"Original equipment manufacturer\") for resale. It grew to become the most popular version of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-27) (note that Unix is a multi-user operating system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft had gotten out of the Unix business, except for its ownership stake in [SCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenServer \"OpenServer\").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-xenix1-20)\n\n[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/PC_DOS_1.10_screenshot.png/250px-PC_DOS_1.10_screenshot.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PC_DOS_1.10_screenshot.png)\n\nA typical [PC DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS \"IBM PC DOS\")[command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface \"Command-line interface\")\n\n[IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\") first approached Gates and Allen about Microsoft's upcoming [IBM Personal Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer \"IBM Personal Computer\") (IBM PC) in July 1980, shortly after Gates's mother began working on [United Way's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Way \"United Way\") executive board with IBM CEO [John Opel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Opel \"John Opel\").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-RoyAllen-26)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-bunnell1982febmar-28) On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with [Digital Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research \"Digital Research\") failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide a version of the [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M \"CP/M\") operating system, which was set to be used in the IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M \"CP/M\") clone called [86-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/86-DOS \"86-DOS\") from [Tim Paterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Paterson \"Tim Paterson\") of [Seattle Computer Products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Computer_Products \"Seattle Computer Products\") for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to [IBM PC DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS \"IBM PC DOS\"). The original CP/M was made by [Gary Kildall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kildall \"Gary Kildall\") of [Digital Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research \"Digital Research\"), Inc. Due to potential [copyright infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement \"Copyright infringement\") problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-30) Thirty-five of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-bunnell1982febmar-28)\n\n_InfoWorld_ stated in 1984 that Microsoft, with $55 million (~$137 million in 2023) in 1983 sales,[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-caruso19840402-24)\n\n> is widely recognized as the most influential company in the microcomputer-software industry. Claiming more than a million installed MS-DOS machines, founder and chairman Bill Gates has decided to certify Microsoft's jump on the rest of the industry by dominating applications, operating systems, peripherals and, most recently, book publishing.

Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, [Microsoft Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel \"Microsoft Excel\") and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server \"Microsoft SQL Server\") on January 13, 1988, a [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system \"Relational database management system\") for companies that was based on technology licensed from [Sybase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybase \"Sybase\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7)\n\n_Computerworld_ wrote in 1987 that \"Gates has pushed [Windows] almost fanaticallly for years\".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-barney19871102-40) On May 22, 1990, Microsoft launched [Windows 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0 \"Windows 3.0\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10) The new version of Microsoft's operating system boasted new features such as streamlined graphic [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface \"User interface\")[GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface \"Graphical user interface\") and improved [protected mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode \"Protected mode\") ability for the [Intel 386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386 \"I386\") processor; it sold over 100,000 copies in two weeks.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-52) Windows at the time generated more revenue for Microsoft than OS/2, and the company decided to move more resources from OS/2 to Windows.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-OS/2history-53) In an internal memo to Microsoft employees on May 16, 1991, Bill Gates announced that the OS/2 partnership was over, and that Microsoft would henceforth focus its platform efforts on Windows and the [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT \"Windows NT\")[kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) \"Kernel (operating system)\").

The station was launched on July 15, 1996, to compete with similar news outlets such as [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN \"CNN\").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-66) Microsoft also launched [Slate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine) \"Slate (magazine)\"), an [online magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_magazine \"Online magazine\") edited by [Michael Kinsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kinsley \"Michael Kinsley\"), which offered political and social commentary along with the cartoon _[Doonesbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doonesbury \"Doonesbury\")_.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) In an attempt to extend its reach in the consumer market, the company acquired [WebTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV \"MSN TV\"), which enabled consumers to access the Web from their televisions.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7)\n\n[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/300lx.jpg/250px-300lx.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:300lx.jpg)\n\n[HP 300LX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_300LX \"HP 300LX\") running [Windows CE 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE \"Windows CE\")\n\nMicrosoft entered the personal digital assistant (PDA) market in November with [Windows CE 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE_1.0 \"Windows CE 1.0\"), a new built-from-scratch version of their flagship operating system, designed to run on low-memory, low-performance machines, such as handhelds and other small computers.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-cehistory-67) 1996 saw the release of [Windows NT 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_4.0 \"Windows NT 4.0\"), which brought the Windows 95 GUI and Windows NT kernel together.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-68)\n\nWhile Microsoft largely failed to participate in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was [ActiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX \"ActiveX\"), an application programming interface built on the [Microsoft Component Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Component_Object_Model \"Microsoft Component Object Model\") ([COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model \"Component Object Model\")); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language \"Programming language\"), including the company's own [scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language \"Scripting language\"), such as [JScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript \"JScript\") and [VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript \"VBScript\"). ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10) The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10) In November 1996, [Microsoft Office 97](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_97 \"Microsoft Office 97\") was released, which is the first version to include [Office Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant \"Office Assistant\"). In 1997, [Internet Explorer 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_4 \"Internet Explorer 4\").0 was released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape \"Netscape\"), and by agreement with Apple, Internet Explorer was bundled with the [Apple Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh \"Macintosh\") operating system as well as with Windows.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10)[Windows CE 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE_2.0 \"Windows CE 2.0\"), the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-cehistory-67) In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the [federal district court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court \"United States district court\") in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7)\n\n[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/Windows98.png/250px-Windows98.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windows98.png)\n\n[Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98 \"Windows 98\") desktop\n\nThe year 1998 was significant in Microsoft's history, with Bill Gates appointing [Steve Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer \"Steve Ballmer\") as president of Microsoft but remaining as chair and CEO himself.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) The company released an update to the consumer version of Windows, [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98 \"Windows 98\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) Windows 98 came with Internet Explorer 4.0 SP1 (which had [Windows Desktop Update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Desktop_Update \"Windows Desktop Update\") bundled), and included new features from Windows 95 OSR 2.x including the [FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table \"File Allocation Table\")[file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system \"File system\"), and new features designed for Windows 98, such as support for multiple displays.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-69) Microsoft launched its Indian headquarters as well, which would eventually become the company's second largest after its U.S. headquarters.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10) Finally, a great deal of controversy took place when a set of internal memos from the company were leaked on the Internet. These documents, colloquially referred to as \"[The Halloween Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents \"Halloween documents\")\", were widely reported by the media and went into detail of the threats that [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software \"Free software\") / [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software \"Open source software\") poses to Microsoft's own software, previously voiced mainly by analysts and advocates of open source software. The documents also alluded to legal and other actions against [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux \"Linux\") as well as other open source software.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-71) While Microsoft acknowledged the documents, it claimed that they are merely engineering studies. Despite this, some believe that these studies were used in the real strategies of the company.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-72)\n\nMicrosoft, in 2000, released new products for all three lines of the company's flagship operating system, and saw the beginning of the end of one of its most prominent legal cases. On February 17, Microsoft released an update to its business line of software in [Windows 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000 \"Windows 2000\"). It provided a high level of stability similar to that of its [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix \"Unix\") counterparts due to its usage of the [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT \"Windows NT\") kernel, and matching features found in the consumer line of the Windows operating system including a DOS [emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator \"Emulator\") that could run many [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system \"Legacy system\") DOS applications.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10)\n\nOn April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of _[United States v. Microsoft Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\_States\\_v.\\_Microsoft\\_Corp.\\_(2001) \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.

Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal [appeals court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal \"Appeal\"), and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001. On June 15, 2000, the company released a new version of its hand-held operating system, [Windows CE 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CE_3.0 \"Windows CE 3.0\").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-cehistory-67) The main change was the new programming APIs of the software. Previous versions of Windows CE supported only a small subset of the [WinAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API \"Windows API\"), the main development library for Windows, and with Version 3 of Windows CE, the operating system now supported nearly all of the core functionality of the WinAPI. The next update to the consumer line, [Windows ME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me \"Windows Me\") (or Windows Millennium Edition), was released on September 14, 2000.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) It sported several new features such as enhanced multimedia abilities and consumer-oriented PC maintenance options, but is often regarded as one of the worst versions of Windows due to stability problems, restricted real mode DOS support and other issues.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-cnettop10worst-62)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-75)\n\n[![Image 18](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/Windows_XP_Luna.png/250px-Windows_XP_Luna.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windows_XP_Luna.png)\n\n[Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP \"Windows XP\") introduced a [new interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(theme) \"Luna (theme)\"), along with many other [new features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_new_to_Windows_XP \"Features new to Windows XP\"). This screenshot shows Windows XP Professional.\n\nMicrosoft released [Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP \"Windows XP\") and [Office XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_XP \"Microsoft Office XP\") in 2001, a version that aimed to encompass the features of both its business and home product lines. The release included an updated version of the Windows 2000 kernel, enhanced DOS emulation abilities, and many of the home-user features found in previous consumer versions. XP introduced a new graphical user interface, the first such change since Windows 95.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-76) The operating system was the first to require [Microsoft Product Activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Product_Activation \"Microsoft Product Activation\"), an [anti-piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection#Anti-piracy \"Copy protection\") mechanism that requires users to activate the software with Microsoft within 30 days.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7)\n\nMicrosoft entered the multibillion-dollar [game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_console \"Game console\") market dominated by [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony \"Sony\") and [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo \"Nintendo\"), with the release of the [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console) \"Xbox (console)\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) The Xbox finished behind the dominant [PlayStation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2 \"PlayStation 2\") selling 24 million units compared to 155 million overall; however they managed to outsell the [GameCube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube \"GameCube\") which sold 21 million units. Microsoft launched their second console, the [Xbox 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360 \"Xbox 360\"), in 2005– which was more successful than the original. By 2017, the Xbox 360 had sold 84 million units[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-77) but failed to outsell its main rival, the [PlayStation 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3 \"PlayStation 3\"), which sold 87 million units when discontinued.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-WorldPS3Sales-78) The console was also outsold by the [Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii \"Wii\"), which introduced [gesture control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_user_interface \"Natural user interface\") and opened up a new market for video games. Microsoft later used their popular controller-free [Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect \"Kinect\") peripheral to increase the popularity of the Xbox. This was very successful. As of 2011[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Microsoft&action=edit), Kinect was the fastest selling consumer electronics product in history.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-guiness-79) It sold 8 million units from November 4, 2010, to January 3, 2011, (its first 60 days). It averaged 133,333 units per day, outselling the [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone \"IPhone\") and [iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad \"IPad\") over equivalent post-launch periods.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-guiness-79)\n\nIn 2002, Microsoft launched the [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework \".NET Framework\") initiative, along with new versions of some of its development products, such as [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio \"Microsoft Visual Studio\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) The initiative has been an entirely new development API for Windows programming, and included a new programming language, [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) \"C Sharp (programming language)\"). [Windows Server 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2003 \"Windows Server 2003\") was launched, featuring enhanced administration abilities, such as new user interfaces to server tools.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-thocp1-10) In 2004, the company released [Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP_Media_Center_Edition_2005 \"Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005\"), a version of Windows XP designed for multimedia abilities, and [Windows XP Starter Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP_Starter_Edition \"Windows XP Starter Edition\"), a version of Windows XP with a smaller feature set designed for entry-level consumers.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-keyevents-7) However, Microsoft encountered more turmoil in March 2004 when antitrust legal action would be brought against it by the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\") for allegedly abusing its market dominance (see _[Microsoft Corp. v. Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\\_Corp.\\_v.\\_Commission \"Microsoft Corp. v. Commission\")_). Eventually Microsoft was fined €497 million (US$613 million), ordered to divulge certain protocols to competitors, and to produce a new version of its Windows XP platform—called Windows XP Home Edition N—that did not include its [Windows Media Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Player \"Windows Media Player\").[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-80)[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-euantitrust-81) Microsoft was also ordered to produce separate packages of Windows after South Korea also landed a settlement against the company in 2005. It had to pay out US$32 million and produce more than one version of Windows for the country in the same vein as the European Union-one with Windows Media Player and [Windows Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Messenger \"Windows Messenger\") and one without the two programs.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-skorea-82)\n\n[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Bill_Gates_2004.jpg/250px-Bill_Gates_2004.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bill_Gates_2004.jpg)\n\nBill Gates giving a presentation at [IT-Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Copenhagen \"Forum Copenhagen\") in Copenhagen in 2004\n\nIn guise of competing with other Internet Companies such as the search service [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google \"Google\"), in 2005 Microsoft announced a new version of its [MSN search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Search \"MSN Search\") service.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-83) Later, in 2006, the company launched [Microsoft adCenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_adCenter \"Microsoft adCenter\"), a service that offers [pay per click](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_per_click \"Pay per click\") advertisements, in an effort to further develop their search marketing revenue.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#cite_note-84) Soon afterward, Microsoft created the [CodePlex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodePlex \"CodePlex\") collaborative development site for hosting [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software \"Open-source software\") projects.

Among its many products and platforms are the programs [Microsoft Word](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-word) and Microsoft Excel, used by private citizens and corporations all over the world, and the Windows operating system, the most widely-used computer OS by a vast margin.\n\nThe company was founded in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975 by [Bill Gates](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates) and Paul Allen, with the latter leaving Microsoft in 1983 following a diagnosis of Hodgkin disease. Gates would stay on as CEO of the company until 2000, when he voluntarily stepped down, largely to focus on his charitable work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nGates was replaced by Steve Ballmer as the new [Microsoft CEO](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo), serving until he was in turn replaced by [Satya Nadella](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-career-rise) in 2014. Under Nadella's guidance, the company has grown ever more profitable, though there have also been many massive layoffs across Microsoft.\n\nHere's a look in greater detail at Microsoft's history, its many products and services, its financial successes and stumbles, and the foundation its profits helped create.\n\n## **Microsoft's history**\n\nWilliam Henry Gates III, better known as Bill Gates, had a preternatural talent with software, writing his first programs while a young teenager growing up in Seattle, Washington. By the time he graduated high school and went off to Harvard, Gates had already formed a business partnership with his friend and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\n![A young Bill Gates and Paul Allen lean against a desk in a 1970s office.](data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E)\n\nThis was a data analysis venture called Traf-O-Data that employed computers in parsing through information collected by roadway traffic counters. Traf-O-Data was not a business success, but it was the precursor to the [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/leadership/bill-gates), which Allen and Gates founded in the spring of 1975.\n\nInitially based in Albuquerque, as Gates and Allen had been working for the New Mexico-based company Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, the Microsoft headquarters moved to Bellevue, Washington, in early 1979, seeing its founders return to a location near their childhood turf.\n\nThe following year, 1980, was a pivotal one for Microsoft because the technology giant IBM awarded the company a contract that saw a Microsoft operating system used in the vaunted IBM Personal Computer, or PC. This was MS-DOS, the premier OS for several years, supplanted only by [Windows](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-mark-zuckerberg-elon-musk-lesson-of-microsoft-windows-platforms-2024-1), released in 1985, and one of the first graphic interface operating systems the world had ever seen.\n\nWindows would become the dominant computer operating system over the next few decades, during which Microsoft also released software that would become wildly successful, such as the aforementioned Word and [Excel](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-excel), as well as [PowerPoint](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-powerpoint).\n\n![A stack of boxes labeled \"Microsoft Windows 95\" is on display at a store.](data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E)\n\nMicrosoft also developed its an email platform, known as Outlook, and even created a search engine named [Bing](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-bing), and so much more.\n\n## **Microsoft's software**\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Office — today rebranded as [Microsoft 365](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-office-365) — in 1990, and soon the word processing and spreadsheet software therein included (namely Word and Excel) would become all but essential for office employees, students, writers, accountants, and myriad other people around the world.\n\nBut Microsoft hardly stopped with these more basic programs. The company would also develop [OneDrive](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-onedrive), a cloud data storage platform, Microsoft Azure, an advanced cloud computing service that lets you use powerful computers remotely, and [Microsoft Copilot](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-copilot-ai), the company's foray into the new and rapidly expanding world of artificial intelligence.\n\nMany companies rely on Microsoft software, such as [Teams](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams), which helps people communicate, stay on schedule, and share files and documents, while many individuals rely on the advanced web browser [Microsoft Edge](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-edge) to enhance the efficacy of their online searches.\n\nMicrosoft's software is so commonly used, and expertise in its programs have become so valuable, that the company even offers [Microsoft certifications](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-certifications) for IT specialists and developers who work with platforms like Microsoft 365 and [Azure](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-azure).\n\nBeyond work and productivity software, services, and platforms, there is another arena in which Microsoft plays an outsized role: gaming.\n\n## **Microsoft in the gaming world**\n\nMicrosoft has been in the video game world since 1979, when \"Microsoft Adventure\" was released. It was a text-based problem-solving game with a feel not unlike a \"Dungeons & Dragons\"session.\n\n## Related stories\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nThroughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, the company would churn out many video games, but few were mainstream successes save for the many versions of \"Microsoft Flight Simulator,\"which was first released in 1982.\n\nIt wasn't until Microsoft got into the console gaming world that true gaming success arrived. Designed to compete with Sony's successful PlayStation video game console, the [Xbox](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-xbox) was first released in 2001 and would become one of the most popular gaming platforms on the planet.\n\n![Bill Gates unveils the Xbox at a launch event in 2001.](data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E)\n\nNow in its fourth generation of console, the Xbox's most popular games include the franchises \"Call of Duty,\" \"Grand Theft Auto,\" and \"Fortnite,\" to name but a few.\n\nMicrosoft has added to its success and reach in the gaming world beyond its own original creations as well; it has also acquired heavy hitters in the space. For example, in September of the year 2014, Microsoft bought Mojang, maker of the popular gaming property \"Minecraft,\" for $2.5 billion.\n\nAnd then, in October 2023, the software juggernaut bought the gaming giant [Activision Blizzard](https://www.businessinsider.com/activision-blizzard) for the staggering sum of $68.7 billion. These were not Microsoft's only acquisitions, of course.\n\n## **Microsoft acquisitions over the years**\n\nWhile Microsoft had acquired many other brands, products, and companies before the year 1997, that year marked its first major and highly visible move of the kind when Microsoft bought the popular email platform [Hotmail](https://www.businessinsider.com/rip-hotmail-2013-2) for a $500 million, which is nearly a billion dollars today.\n\n## Related stories\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nHotmail was eventually rolled into [Microsoft Outlook](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-outlook-email-hotmail-msn), though you can still get and use a Hotmail email address today.\n\nIn 2011, Microsoft made another powerful move when it acquired the video chat platform [Skype](https://www.businessinsider.com/skype), this time in a multibillion-dollar move.\n\nIn 2016, the software company laid out a hefty $26.2 billion to buy [LinkedIn](https://www.businessinsider.com/hiring-broken-linkedin-ai-fix-fewer-jobs-resume-spammers-2024-10), the widely used professional networking and social media platform.\n\n![LinkedIn's logo can be seen behind the glass facade of the company's headquarters](data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E)\n\nAnd in 2018, Microsoft acquired [GitHub](https://www.businessinsider.com/github), a code developing platform, for the tidy sum of $7.5 billion. All of these acquisitions involve huge numbers, of course, as does the wealth of Microsoft's founder and the endowment of the charitable organization he established with his then-wife, Melinda Gates.\n\n## **Bill Gates and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation by the numbers**\n\nAt last check, [Bill Gates' net worth](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-net-worth) was around $106 billion, making him, the former richest person in the world, not even in the top 10 richest list. He ranked 14th richest, per [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/%22%20%5Cl%20%225ca6de7f3d78), as of late 2024.\n\nGates has given tens of millions of dollars away, largely to his own nonprofit organization, the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation), which is focused on issues ranging from endemic diseases in developing nations to safe water supply issues and combatting hunger.\n\nMarried for 27 years prior to a divorce in the summer of 2021, Bill and [Melinda Gates](https://www.businessinsider.com/melinda-gates) sat together on the board of their eponymous foundation for many years and even for three years following the marital split, though Melinda Gates finally departed the foundation in June 2024.\n\n![A close-up of Melinda Gates shows her holding an earpiece while sitting in front of a microphone.](data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E)\n\nThe foundation, which has offices in multiple countries across four continents, employs more than 2,000 people and has an endowment of more than $75 billion. According to data sourced from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation itself, in recent years it has offered charitable support between $7 and $8 billion, and the foundation had issued more than $77 billion in grant payments since its inception through the year 2023.\n\nThat's all an impressive amount of money, to be sure, and given for noble causes, but it pales in comparison to the profits of the Microsoft Corporation, profits that are often maintained thanks to harsh rounds of employee layoffs.\n\n## **Microsoft finances, revenues, careers, and layoffs**\n\nMicrosoft went public with its IPO in 1986 at a price of $21 per share. In the decades since, [Microsoft stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/msft-stock) pricing has swelled exponentially, and the company's total market cap — which is the entire value of a company's outstanding shares — reached an astonishing $3 trillion dollars by late 2024.\n\nFor a bit of perspective, that is larger than the annual gross domestic product of almost every nation on earth — were Microsoft's market cap placed on the scale with GDP, it would rank between France and Germany.\n\nFor the 12-month period ending in June 2024, [Microsoft earnings](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-earnings) were around $245 billion — in a one-year period, to be clear, the company generated nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars. It's no wonder, then, that [Microsoft careers](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-careers-jobs) are highly sought after.\n\nBut jobs, though often lucrative, are also often tenuous. [Microsoft's layoffs](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs) are often notorious for their size. For example, in the early fall of 2024, the company cut 650 workers from its gaming division only a few months after slashing 1,900 employees from its Activision Blizzard and Xbox departments.\n\nIn 2023, the company cut a huge swath of its labor force, dropping 10,000 workers. This was not the biggest layoff, though: between 2014 and 2015, the company axed nearly 20,000 employees. This was following the problematic acquisition of the telecom company Nokia, which also saw the exit of then-CEO Steve Ballmer.\n\n### Recommended video\n\n## Read next\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png)\n\n### Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\n## BI Tech Memo\n\nWhere Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.\nSign up \nchevron down icon\nAn icon in the shape of an angle pointing down.\n\n![Business Insider](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg)\n![Download on the App Store](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg)\n![Get it on Google Play](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg)\n![Insider.com TM Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg)\n![Insider](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg)\n![Insider-Inc Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg)\n![Tech Insider Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg)\n![Business Insider DE Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg)\n![Insider Media Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg)\n![Insider Media Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg)\n![News Insider Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg)\n![Silicon Alley Logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![](/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg)\n![](https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=tech)\n\nJump to"

Established in 1975 by [Bill Gates](https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/bill-gates-the-man-who-put-a-computer-in-every-home) and Paul Allen, Microsoft arguably invented the software domain and significantly influenced the evolution of personal computing as we know it today.\n\nBill Gates and Paul Allen, childhood friends from Lakeside School in Seattle, shared an early enthusiasm for computers. Their partnership began with a venture called Traf-O-Data, aimed at processing and analyzing traffic tapes. Although it was not a commercial success, it provided them with valuable experience in running a business and in the intricacies of software development.\n\nBill Gates' father, William Henry Gates II, reportedly played a substantial role in shaping his son's interests and values, particularly in business. Gates II was a prominent lawyer and a co-founder of the Seattle law firm Preston Gates & Ellis, which today is one of the largest law firms in the U.S. Thus, from a young age, Bill was exposed to discussions about business and law, as his father often shared stories and lessons from his own professional experiences. This early exposure to the legal and business worlds helped Bill develop a strategic approach to problem-solving and negotiations, which would later be pivotal in his career at Microsoft.\n\nThe true catalyst for Microsoft's founding was the development of the Altair 8800 by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), considered the first commercially successful personal computer. Allen saw a demonstration of the Altair 8800 on the cover of a January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which inspired him to propose that they develop software for it. Realizing the potential, Gates and Allen contacted MITS to offer their at the time rare programming skills.\n\nTo demonstrate their capabilities, Gates and Allen developed an interpreter for the programming language BASIC, tailored for the Altair. Without an actual Altair at their disposal, they used a simulator that Allen wrote on a minicomputer, and then later, when they finally tested their software on a real Altair, their code worked successfully on the first try. This successful demonstration led to them founding \"Micro-Soft\" on April 4, 1975, a blend of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\". The company's name, initially hyphenated as \"Micro-Soft,\" was suggested by Allen. On November 26, 1976, the company was officially registered as Microsoft Corporation.\n\n![Image 4: Edge_CTA_cover_1](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1485x523/672c32d934/edge_cta_cover_1.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))\n\n![Image 5: Edge_CTA_cover_1](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1485x523/672c32d934/edge_cta_cover_1.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))\n\n**Join 100,000+ other business enthusiasts**\n\n_Sign up for Edge, our free bi-weekly newsletter._\n\n*   [Sign up](https://quartr.com/edge)\n    \n\nMicrosoft and IBM: The Partnership that Defined an Era in Computing\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the most significant events in the history of personal computing was the partnership between [Microsoft](https://quartr.com/companies/microsoft-corporation_4417) and [IBM](https://quartr.com/companies/international-business-machines-corp_6065) in 1980. This collaboration not only catapulted Microsoft into the forefront of software development but also set the stage for the widespread adoption of personal computers across businesses and homes globally. Bill Gates played a pivotal role in securing and nurturing this partnership.\n\nBefore the partnership, IBM was primarily known for its dominance in the large-scale computer market, selling hardware to major corporations and governments. In 1980, IBM was in the process of developing its first personal computer, the IBM PC, and needed an operating system that would appeal to a broad market. IBM initially approached Digital Research, the creators of the popular CP/M operating system, but negotiations faltered over issues related to signing a non-disclosure agreement and other business terms.\n\nSeeing an opportunity, Bill Gates stepped in. Despite Microsoft not having an operating system at the time, Gates made a bold promise to deliver what IBM needed. This move was characterized by Gates' vision and his understanding of the strategic stakes involved.\n\nTo fulfill the promise made to IBM, Microsoft purchased an existing operating system called 86-DOS (originally QDOS, for Quick and Dirty Operating System) from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000. Microsoft then adapted this system into MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System), which was to be compatible with the IBM PC hardware.\n\nGates' decision not to sell the operating system outright to IBM but instead to license it per copy was groundbreaking. This licensing model allowed Microsoft to retain control over the software and later sell it to other PC manufacturers as well, establishing MS-DOS as a standard in the exploding PC industry.\n\n[![Image 6: IBM vs Microsoft – the tale of hardware vs software](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2362/f71b71d9a5/ibm-vs-microsoft_revenue-comparison.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2362/f71b71d9a5/ibm-vs-microsoft_revenue-comparison.png)\n\nIBM. vs Microsoft: four decades of revenue growth\n\n[![Image 7: IBM vs Microsoft – the tale of hardware vs software](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2362/f71b71d9a5/ibm-vs-microsoft_revenue-comparison.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2362/f71b71d9a5/ibm-vs-microsoft_revenue-comparison.png)\n\nIBM. vs Microsoft: four decades of revenue growth\n\nThe IBM PC was launched in 1981 with MS-DOS as its primary operating system, and the PC's success exceeded expectations. Microsoft’s partnership and association with IBM gave it immense credibility and a dominant position in the software market from the start.\n\nBill Gates' role in securing and managing the partnership with IBM was crucial. His strategic decision-making and risk-taking, evident in the acquisition of 86-DOS and the structuring of the licensing deal, were instrumental in setting Microsoft on a path to industry dominance already from the inception of the software domain. That's right. Gates remarkably anticipated the significance of software licensing in an era when software was a completely new domain. Also, the non-exclusive nature of the deal allowed Microsoft to instantly become a leader in software, as it could also sell to those who copied IBM's hardware. This insight from the then very young Bill Gates is arguably one of the most crucial business decisions in the history of Microsoft.\n\n### The tale of hardware vs. software visualized\n\n[![Image 8: IBM vs Microsoft – Market cap comparison 1986-2024](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2339/d099b7b256/ibm-vs-microsoft_marketcap-comparison.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2339/d099b7b256/ibm-vs-microsoft_marketcap-comparison.png)\n\nIBM vs. Microsoft: Visualizing the development of market cap\n\n[![Image 9: IBM vs Microsoft – Market cap comparison 1986-2024](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2339/d099b7b256/ibm-vs-microsoft_marketcap-comparison.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/2000x2339/d099b7b256/ibm-vs-microsoft_marketcap-comparison.png)\n\nIBM vs. Microsoft: Visualizing the development of market cap\n\n**Four intriguing facts:**\n\n*   In 1981, IBM sparked the personal computing revolution with the release of its blockbuster IBM PC.\n    \n*   Microsoft was assigned to develop the operating system under a non-exclusive deal, instantly catapulting the company into a market-leading position in software.\n    \n*   In 1986, Microsoft went public with a market cap equaling 1% of IBM's, which at the time was the largest company in the world.\n    \n*   IBM's market cap now equals roughly 5% of Microsoft's, which now is the largest company in the world with a market cap exceeding $3 trillion.\n    \n\nThe Evolution of Microsoft Windows\n----------------------------------\n\nMicrosoft launched the first version of Windows, Windows 1.0, in November 1985. This graphical interface was built on top of MS-DOS, a text-based operating system. Windows 1.0 was not a standalone operating system but rather an operating environment that offered a graphical way to manage files and applications, one of the first of its kind. Despite its modest start and mixed reviews, it laid the groundwork for a GUI-based interaction model on PC platforms.\n\nBill Gates played a crucial role in the development and promotion of Windows from the very start. His vision was to create a system that would be accessible to the general public, enhancing the user experience through a graphical user interface (GUI) that differed markedly from the command-line interfaces of the time. He also reportedly saw this as an immense opportunity to create a competitive advantage for Microsoft; if people began working within their user interface and adhering to their standards, they would likely be reluctant to switch in the future. One could argue that this insight marked the first conscious creation of switching costs as a competitive advantage.\n\nAugust 1995 saw the release of Windows 95, a major leap in Windows history. It revolutionized user interfaces with the introduction of the Start menu, taskbar, and minimize/maximize/close buttons on each window. Windows 95 was a significant overhaul that offered a more intuitive way for users to navigate their computers, and it was the first version marketed as a standalone operating system. This was arguably the turning point for when the operating system was intuitive and good enough to gain massive adoption among the public.\n\nBill Gates was instrumental in driving the development and aggressive marketing of Windows 95. The launch was a cultural phenomenon, marked by a massive media campaign and unprecedented hype, which famously included the licensing of the Rolling Stones' song \"Start Me Up\" to highlight the new Start button.\n\n### Microsoft in Numbers – The Largest Company in the World\n\nAs aforementioned, the release of Windows 95 marked a major leap in Microsoft's financial and market dominance. This operating system became incredibly popular, driving PC sales and associated software, which ballooned Microsoft's revenue. By the late 1990s, Microsoft had firmly established itself as a major player in the tech industry, with revenues soaring from about $2.9 billion in 1990 to over $23 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nEntering the new millennium, Microsoft continued to expand its product lineup beyond Windows and Office with entries into gaming (Xbox), enterprise services and cloud (Microsoft Azure), and hardware (Surface devices). In 2019, Microsoft reached a significant milestone by briefly topping $1 trillion in market capitalization, becoming the third U.S. public company to do so, after [Apple](https://quartr.com/companies/apple-inc_4742) and [Amazon](https://quartr.com/companies/amazoncom-inc_4762).\n\nMicrosoft reported a revenue of over $198 billion in FY 2023, with a notable growth in cloud computing and business productivity sectors. Microsoft Azure has emerged as a key competitor to Amazon Web Services, capturing a significant share of the enormous and continuously growing cloud market.\n\n[![Image 10: Microsoft Azure and other cloud services: revenue growth per quarter](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1901x2349/beb54d949a/msft-azure-revenue-growth-per-quarter.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1901x2349/beb54d949a/msft-azure-revenue-growth-per-quarter.png)\n\nAzure and Other Cloud Services Revenue Growth Per Quartr\n\n[![Image 11: Microsoft Azure and other cloud services: revenue growth per quarter](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1901x2349/beb54d949a/msft-azure-revenue-growth-per-quarter.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/1901x2349/beb54d949a/msft-azure-revenue-growth-per-quarter.png)\n\nAzure and Other Cloud Services Revenue Growth Per Quartr\n\nMicrosoft's ability to adapt to market needs and innovate in areas like artificial intelligence and cloud computing has helped sustain its growth over time.

From LinkedIn and Skype to GitHub and Activision Blizzard, these acquisitions have contributed significantly to Microsoft's growth and its position in several markets.\n\nMicrosoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard on January 18, 2022, for $68.7 billion. This deal aimed at bolstering Microsoft's Xbox gaming division with a vast library of games and game development capabilities. However, the acquisition faced regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU. The deal was finalized roughly one and a half years later, in October 2023.\n\nThe acquisition of Activision Blizzard is Microsoft's largest ever and one of the largest in business history. For those who may not be aware, Activision Blizzard is one of the largest game developers and publishers, known for blockbuster franchises such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch.\n\n### Four decades of Microsoft\n\n[![Image 14: Infograph visualizing Microsofts acquisitions since 1985](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/3654x4212/5deb081fcd/microsoft-four-decades-of-acquisitions.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/3654x4212/5deb081fcd/microsoft-four-decades-of-acquisitions.png)\n\nVisualizing four decades of Microsoft\n\n[![Image 15: Infograph visualizing Microsofts acquisitions since 1985](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/3654x4212/5deb081fcd/microsoft-four-decades-of-acquisitions.png/m/3840x0/filters:quality(100))](https://a.storyblok.com/f/182663/3654x4212/5deb081fcd/microsoft-four-decades-of-acquisitions.png)\n\nVisualizing four decades of Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft's most notable acquisitions\n-------------------------------------\n\n### Skype\n\nAcquired in 2011 for $8.5 billion.

      "title": "A Brief History of Microsoft - The Worlds Biggest Software Company",
      "content": "Microsoft is an American multinational computer technology corporation whose history started 4th April 1975. Formed by Harvard College dropout, Bill Gates and his childhood friend Paul Allen, Microsoft has now become the biggest software company. It is also one of the most valuable companies in the world (before you read on you can find out more about our Microsoft Services here).\n\n### So how did Microsoft become so successful? [...] Windows 7 was released in 2009 to replace Vista which secured Microsoft’s lead in the software market. This was followed by the release of Windows 8 in Oct 2012 which included major changes to its OS platform and user interface to improve user experience on tablets. Since then Windows 8.1 has been released (October 2013) which contained more improvements. [...] Microsoft before 1990 was predominantly a supplier to the hardware manufacturers. That was their target market. As technology advanced and personal computers become so popular, the bulk of Microsoft’s revenue was generated from sales to consumers. It was the first software company to reach $1 Billion in revenues.

Formed by Harvard College dropout, Bill Gates and his childhood friend Paul Allen, Microsoft has now become the biggest software company. It is also one of the most valuable companies in the world (before you read on you can find out more about our [Microsoft Services here](https://www.dsp.co.uk/sql-server-consultancy)).\n\n### **So how did Microsoft become so successful?**\n\nMicrosoft is engaged in developing, licensing and supporting a range of software products and services catering to different requirements. In 2000 Steve Ballmer was appointed the new CEO of Microsoft. Bill Gates had met Steve Ballmer at Harvard University before he left. Although there was some concern over Ballmer’s ability, Microsoft retained its top spot in both business and personal computer markets. Microsoft’s primary strengths and most of its profits were obtained from the business side. Although the company recognised that they had a major presence in consumer markets as technology advances.\n\nThe successful Altair deal back in January 1975 inspired Bill Gates and Paul Allen to form Microsoft. Their revenues for 1975 totalled $16,000. Microsoft's big break was in 1980 when a partnership was formed with IBM which resulted in Microsoft providing a crucial operating system, DOS, for IBM PCs. This meant that for every IBM Computer sold a royalty was paid to Microsoft. In 1990, Gates showed the future plan for Microsoft with the introduction of Windows 3.0. 60 million copies of Windows had been sold now which effectively made Microsoft the sole keeper of the PC software standard.\n\nMicrosoft before 1990 was predominantly a supplier to the hardware manufacturers. That was their target market. As technology advanced and personal computers become so popular, the bulk of Microsoft’s revenue was generated from sales to consumers. It was the first software company to reach $1 Billion in revenues. As more and more versions of Microsoft Windows were launched, Microsoft captured a higher market share of the world’s PC (around 90%).\n\nProject Longhorn in 2001, saw many of Microsoft’s previous operating systems being replaced starting with Vista. Vista was released to the general public in 2007 and it was the new operating system. There were many Vista options available catering for different consumers; Home (Basic or Premium), Ultimate, Business and many more. Microsoft’s core customers, the corporate market preferred Windows XP as the operating system was fast, stable and secure.\n\nWindows 7 was released in 2009 to replace Vista which secured Microsoft’s lead in the software market. This was followed by the release of Windows 8 in Oct 2012 which included major changes to its OS platform and user interface to improve user experience on tablets. Since then Windows 8.1 has been released (October 2013) which contained more improvements.\n\nMicrosoft also entered the gaming and mobile phone market and was successful in capturing a large market share. The Windows Mobile OS is used by numerous sellers including HTC, LG, Samsung and LG. In 2001 Microsoft released the Xbox followed by Xbox Live in 2002. Both releases were very successful which placed Microsoft second in the video gaming market. The Xbox 360, released in 2005 was a very powerful gaming console while facing strong competition. Microsoft had to cut the prices of their gaming consoles to gain a higher market share due to competition. This was a successful move; the Xbox 360 was the most used game console in American homes.\n\nMicrosoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 Billion; this was the largest acquisition in Microsoft’s history. Microsoft acquired Skype to compete with Apple’s Facetime and Google’s Voice. Microsoft planned to add Skype to its products such as Outlook, Xbox and Windows smartphones.\n\nMicrosoft has also recently moved into cloud computing with the Windows [Azure](https://www.dsp.co.uk/microsoft-azure-services) platform which was announced in 2008. The Windows Azure platform lets consumers build computing infrastructure in the “cloud” and offer it to its users. In 2011, Office 365, a cloud version of Office business software suite was released which included applications such as Word and Excel.\n\nAnother popular product, [Microsoft's SQL Server](https://www.dsp.co.uk/sql-server-consultancy \"Microsoft's SQL Server\") 2012, featured many enhancements to previous versions. This included Always On which provided options to improve the database availability and easy cloud set-up and compatibility. Features also included performance and programmability enhancements. DSP provides support for all versions and features of Microsoft [SQL Servers](https://www.dsp.co.uk/sql-server-support \"SQL Server Support\"), across a wide variety of windows platforms.\n\nFor more information,[get in touch](mailto:enquiries@dsp.co.uk)with our experts to find out more about our [Microsoft Services](https://www.dsp.co.uk/sql-server-consultancy)[](https://www.dsp.co.uk/data-science-services)or book a meeting...\n\n[Book a Meeting](https://content.dsp.co.uk/cs/c/?cta_guid=b7ef3ead-1361-47b2-95fd-bc24ae8e6c34&signature=AAH58kFSukxaRf-UlSvi8IIrS6f3S8-ZkQ&portal_id=3321273&pageId=13460330250&placement_guid=3414edc1-fbe5-40fe-9b35-42e662d82b55&click=6c2e980e-c27d-4bb7-b5c8-f424e665a122&redirect_url=APefjpFhesniAqSAV1KOpMw8_EsgIDKAZW9op1Nc9j-yWmwVoGEq_J9fdw8jV4PPkSfp8rESzoJwLdioIKeMJTHShLEuaHMhoS5fYX8QYTkE_vqWmlhOLzV3y9AI2EzRYcqMnZklbsKI&hsutk=&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.dsp.co.uk%2Fa-brief-history-of-microsoft-the-worlds-biggest-software-company&ts=1749055273466 \"Book a Meeting\")\n\nIf you liked this blog, make sure to check out the rest of our blogs [here](https://www.dsp.co.uk/blogs), which include content on Oracle Database, SQL Server, Google Cloud, Open Source Databases, Data Science and much more.\n\n[Microsoft](https://content.dsp.co.uk/topic/microsoft)\n\n[08-Feb-2016 12:05:26 What Is Microsoft Azure?

born](https://msftstories.thesourcemediaassets.com/2019/01/Microsoft-Founded-1.jpg)\n\nInspired by the January cover of Popular Electronics magazine, friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft – sometimes Micro-Soft, for microprocessors and software – to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer.\n\nIn 1980, the pair struck a deal to provide the operating system for IBM’s first personal computer. Microsoft released Windows in 1985, a year before moving its headquarters to Redmond, Washington. By the late 1980s, Microsoft was the world’s largest personal-computer software company.\n\nExplore More\n------------\n\n[![Image 3: Journalists covering an

Editors](https://www.history.com/authors/history)\n\nPublished: October 09, 2015\n\nLast Updated: February 18, 2025\n\nPrint\n\nCopy\n\nOn April 4, 1975, at a time when most Americans used typewriters, childhood friends [Bill Gates](https://www.biography.com/people/bill-gates-9307520) and Paul Allen found Microsoft, a company that makes computer software. Originally based in Albuquerque, [New Mexico](https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/new-mexico), Microsoft relocated to [Washington](https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/washington) State in 1979 and eventually grew into a major multinational technology corporation. In 1987, the year after Microsoft went public, 31-year-old Gates became the world’s youngest billionaire.\n\nGates and Allen started Microsoft—originally called Micro-Soft, for microprocessors and software—in order to produce software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. Allen quit his job as a programmer in Boston and Gates left Harvard University, where he was a student, to focus on their new company, which was based in Albuquerque because the city was home to electronics firm MITS, maker of the Altair 8800.\n\n### History Uncut: Bill Gates unveils Microsoft Excel 1987\n\nHistory Uncut The History Channel: 1987 - A young Gates, donned with oversized glasses that refuse to stay in place, answers questions from the press about his dazzling new software Microsoft Excel, which \"really improves the quality of your output.\" This video clip is courtesy of The History Channel.\n\n![Image 2](https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/21/175/History_Bill_Gates_Unveils_Microsoft_Excel_SF_HD.jpg?w=600)\n\n![Image 3](https://cropper.watch.aetnd.com/public-content-aetn.video.aetnd.com/video-thumbnails/AETN-History_VMS/21/175/History_Bill_Gates_Unveils_Microsoft_Excel_SF_HD.jpg?w=600)\n\nBy the end of 1978, Microsoft’s sales topped more than $1 million and in 1979 the business moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, where Gates and Allen grew up. The company went on to license its MS-DOS operating system to IBM for its first personal computer, which debuted in 1981. Afterward, other computer companies started licensing MS-DOS, which had no graphical interface and required users to type in commands in order to open a program. In 1983, Allen departed Microsoft after being diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma; he was successfully treated for the disease and went on to pursue a variety of other business ventures.\n\nIn 1985, Microsoft released a new operating system, Windows, with a graphical user interface that included drop-down menus, scroll bars and other features. The following year, the company moved its headquarters to Redmond, Washington, and went public at $21 a share, raising $61 million. By the late 1980s, Microsoft had become the world’s biggest personal-computer software company, based on sales. In 1995, amidst skyrocketing purchases of personal computers for home and office use, Windows 95 made its debut. It included such innovations as the Start menu (TV commercials for Windows 95 featured the Rolling Stones singing “Start Me Up”) and 7 million copies of the new product were sold in the first five weeks. During the second half of the 1990s, Internet usage took off, and Microsoft introduced its web browser, Internet Explorer, in 1995.\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice and 20 state attorneys general charged Microsoft with violating antitrust laws by using its dominance to drive competitors out of business; in 2001, the company reached a settlement with the government that imposed restrictions on its corporate practices. Also in 2001, Microsoft joined the videogame market with the [launch of its Xbox](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/microsoft-releases-xbox-gaming-console) console.\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nAlso on This Day in History\n---------------------------\n\nDiscover more of the major events, famous births, notable deaths and everything else history-making that happened on April 4th\n\n[1776 ### General George Washington begins march to New York After the successful siege of Boston, General George Washington begins marching his unpaid soldiers from their headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, toward New York in anticipation of a British invasion, on April 4, 1776.

The headquarters were then moved, splitting between two locations; Tower 1 of 201 Sussex Street and the Commonwealth Bank Place; a new complex of two nine-storey buildings in [Darling Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Harbour \"Darling Harbour\") on the western side of Sydney's city centre.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-6) In 2022, the headquarters were consolidated into the Commonwealth Bank Place, with Tower 1 of 201 Sussex Street remaining as a secondary head office.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-7)\n\nIn 2018, findings from the [Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_Misconduct_in_the_Banking,_Superannuation_and_Financial_Services_Industry \"Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry\") have indicated a negative culture within the bank, amid allegations of fraud, deception, and money laundering, among various other crimes.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-8)\n\nIn 2022, the Commonwealth Bank held the 49th position in the \"Top 1000 World Banks\".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-9) As of August 2024 it is listed as the 66th largest company in the world by market cap.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_Bank&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\n### Foundation (1911–1919)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_Bank&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Foundation (1911–1919)\")]\n\nSee also: [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia \"Reserve Bank of Australia\")\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia was established by the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1911_, introduced by the [Andrew Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fisher \"Andrew Fisher\")[Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party \"Australian Labor Party\") government, which favoured bank [nationalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalisation \"Nationalisation\"), with effect on 22 December 1911.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-CN_MP-TDMP2-R-02-10)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-CN_MP-TDMP2-R-03-11) In a rare move for the time, the bank was to have both savings and general bank business. The bank was also the first bank in Australia to receive a federal government guarantee. The bank's earliest and most strenuous proponent was the flamboyant American-Australian Labor politician [King O'Malley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_O%27Malley \"King O'Malley\"), and its first governor was Sir [Denison Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denison_Miller \"Denison Miller\").\n\nThe bank opened its first branch in [Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne \"Melbourne\") on 15 July 1912.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-12) In an agreement with [Australia Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post \"Australia Post\") that exists to this day, the bank also traded through post office agencies.

The bank's chairman Sir Robert Gibson refused to expand credit in response to the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression \"Great Depression\"), as had been proposed by Treasurer [Edward Theodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Theodore \"Ted Theodore\") unless the government cut pensions, which Scullin refused to do. The conflict surrounding this issue led to the fall of the government, and to demands from Labor for reform of the bank and more direct government control over monetary policy.\n\nAlso in 1931, it took over the savings bank business of the [Government Savings Bank of New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Government_Savings_Bank_of_New_South_Wales&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Government Savings Bank of New South Wales (page does not exist)\") (est. 1871), the current account and fixed deposit business of the NSW Rural Bank Department, and the State Savings Bank of Western Australia (est. 1863).\n\nIn 1942, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation (CBC) suspended its operations in [Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea \"Papua New Guinea\") as the [Imperial Japanese Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army \"Imperial Japanese Army\") captured many of the towns in which it operated, and bombed [Port Moresby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby \"Port Moresby\"). The bank resumed operations later, possibly in 1944.\n\nThe bank had many branches across Papua New Guinea including Port Moresby, Boroko, Rabaul, Lae, Wau, Bulolo, Goroka, Kavieng, Madang, Mount Hagen, Kundiawa, Popondetta, and Wewak. On Bougainville, there was Kieta, Panguna, Arawa and early on a part-time sub-branch at Loloho. It maintained those facilities to support trade, local business, government, and small savers.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank received almost all central bank powers in emergency legislation passed during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") and at the end of the war, it used this power to begin a dramatic expansion of the economy. This was also the aim of the federal government at the time, which attempted to compel the Australian states to conduct their banking with the Commonwealth under the _Banking Act 1945_ (Cth), but the High Court in _Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth_ (1947) 74 CLR 31, blocked this move.\n\nIn August 1945, the federal government of [Ben Chifley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chifley \"Ben Chifley\") passed the _Commonwealth Bank Act, 1945_, which repealed the 1925 act and abolished the Board of Directors, returning full executive control of the bank to the governor.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-18)\n\nThe government also dramatically expanded immigration programs. In response, the bank established a Migrant Information Service (later known as the Australian Financial & Migrant Information Service, or AFMIS). The bank expanded during this period, and in just five years it opened hundreds of branches throughout Australia and in 1951 it established a branch in the [Solomon Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands \"Solomon Islands\").\n\nIn 1958 and 1959, there was a controversy concerning the dual functions of the organization, operating as the central bank on the one hand and a commercial bank on the other. As a result, the government separated the two roles, creating the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia \"Reserve Bank of Australia\") to exercise the central bank function, and leaving the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to operate purely as a commercial bank. Those commercial functions were exercised by the organization's constituent sections: the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, and the newly formed Commonwealth Development Bank.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1976 the Commonwealth Bank operated savings bank agencies in the [New Hebrides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hebrides \"New Hebrides\").\n\n### Diversification (1960–1991)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_Bank&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Diversification (1960–1991)\")]\n\n[![Image 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Commonwealth_Bank_old_logo.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Commonwealth_Bank_old_logo.jpg)\n\n1980s logo\n\nA new Commonwealth Development Bank was established in 1960 and during the 1970s the bank diversified its business into areas like insurance and travel. It established a finance company, CBFC in 1974. The bank also became more heavily involved in foreign currency trading and international banking in general.\n\nThe bank actively supported the introduction of [decimal currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_currency \"Decimal currency\") in the years leading up to 1966 and, like most banks, it gradually converted its paper records onto a new computer-based system. The bank created the first [credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card \"Credit card\") in Australia in 1974 when it established [Bankcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankcard \"Bankcard\"). In later years the bank began offering [MasterCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterCard \"MasterCard\") (1984) and [Visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_(credit_card) \"Visa (credit card)\") (1993) cards as well.\n\nIn 1974, as [Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea \"Papua New Guinea\") approached independence, the bank formally handed over its PNG operations to the newly created and government-owned [Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_South_Pacific \"Bank South Pacific\") (PNGBC). The bank retained a restricted branch in Port Moresby that it finally closed in 1982.\n\nIn 1981 the bank transferred its operations in the [Solomon Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands \"Solomon Islands\") to the [National Bank of Solomon Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Solomon_Islands \"National Bank of Solomon Islands\"), which operated as a joint venture (51% Commonwealth Bank, 49% Government of the Solomon Islands).\n\nIn 1989 the bank acquired 75 per cent of [ASB Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASB_Bank \"ASB Bank\") in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand \"New Zealand\").\n\nIn 1991 the bank acquired the failing Victorian Government-owned [State Bank of Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_Victoria \"State Bank of Victoria\") (est. 1842).[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-19)\n\n### Privatisation (1991–present)\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_Bank&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Privatisation (1991–present)\")]\n\n[![Image 9](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Commonwealth_Bank.svg/250px-Commonwealth_Bank.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Commonwealth_Bank.svg)\n\nLogo used until 2020\n\n[![Image 10](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/%281%29Commonwealth_Bank_Sydney.jpg/250px-%281%29Commonwealth_Bank_Sydney.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:(1)Commonwealth_Bank_Sydney.jpg)\n\n48 [Martin Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Place \"Martin Place\"); the Commonwealth Bank's headquarters from 1990-2009[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-:0-20)\n\nBetween 1991 and 1996 the Australian Government under the [Keating government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keating_government \"Keating government\") fully privatised the Commonwealth Bank. The first share offer in 1991 was valued at $1,292 million, the second in 1993 for $1,700 million and the third was sold for $5,000 million in 1996.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-21) It is a public company, but one of the few such companies in Australia whose official name does not end in 'Limited'.\n\nIn 1994 Commonwealth sold its shares in [National Bank of Solomon Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Solomon_Islands \"National Bank of Solomon Islands\") to [Bank of Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Hawaii \"Bank of Hawaii\"). In 1994, Commonwealth took a 50% share in PT Bank International Indonesia.\n\nOn 10 March 2000, the Commonwealth Bank and Colonial Limited announced their intention to merge, with seven Commonwealth Bank shares being offered for twenty Colonial Shares. The merger received final approval from the Supreme Court of Victoria on 31 May 2000 and was completed on 13 June 2000. This brought into the fold Colonial’s stake in [Colonial National Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Bank \"Colonial National Bank\"), the former National Bank of Fiji. The bank also acquired the remaining 25% of [ASB Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASB_Bank \"ASB Bank\").\n\nAsian banking opportunities in 2000, saw the bank acquire full ownership of PT Bank International Indonesia and rename it (PT Bank Commonwealth). This bank now has over 16 branches and has opened several FX shops to cater to Commonwealth Bank clients who are tourists in [Bali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali \"Bali\").\n\nIn 2005, the bank established strategic co-operation agreements with two Chinese banks, Jinan City Commercial Bank and [Hangzhou City Commercial Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou_City_Commercial_Bank \"Hangzhou City Commercial Bank\"); it took an 11% stake in Jinan Commercial, and a 19.9% stake in Hangzhou Commercial.

The breaches related to the bank's use of intelligent deposit machines (IDMs) between November 2012 and September 2015—the bank claimed that a programming error allowed depositors to instantly credit cash deposits to their accounts, whilst failing to report amounts over $10,000 to AUSTRAC, and not enforcing any limits to the number of transactions.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-austrac-60)\n\n### Bank bill swap rate allegations\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_Bank&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Bank bill swap rate allegations\")]\n\nSee also: [Libor scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor_scandal \"Libor scandal\") and [Interbank lending market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbank_lending_market \"Interbank lending market\")\n\nASIC commenced legal proceedings in the Federal Court on 30 January 2018 alleging manipulation of the [bank bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_bill \"Bank bill\") swap rate (BBSW). The BBSW rate is the rate of interest that banks charge to lend money to each other, and is a key interest rate used as the benchmark for interest rates on a number of products, most notably business loans, currency derivatives and floating rate bonds. It is alleged that the manipulations took place on three specific occasions in 2012.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-61)\n\n### BankWest commercial loan book\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commonwealth_Bank&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: BankWest commercial loan book\")]\n\nThe change from [Basel I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_I \"Basel I\") to [Basel II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II \"Basel II\") capitalisation requirements, due to take effect on 1 January 2009, required [BankWest](https://www.bankwest.com.au/) to increase its [Tier 1 capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_capital \"Tier 1 capital\") (share capital) by an additional A$17 billion. BankWest's owner HBOS lent this money to Bankwest, but required the money be repaid to meet HBOS's own capital requirements.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank#cite_note-hearing20151202-62)\n\nHBOS, therefore, agreed to sell BankWest to Commonwealth Bank (CBA) in October 2008.

How that thinking is done and what resources are called on to make subsequent decisions is a key determinant of success.\n\n## Related articles\n\n![ ](/content/dam/commbank-assets/business/ecommerce/choosing%20ecommerce%20platform_artthumb.jpg)\n![ ](/content/dam/commbank-assets/articles/2020-06/woman-giftbox_artthumb.jpg)\n\nIn an increasingly digital business world the most prevalent, informative and powerful resource is data. Most businesses generate more data than they could possibly use. Learning what data is available, what can be generated and what questions to ask of it is the key to more informed and effective business decisions.\n\nThis is called building data literacy – the critical ability to derive meaningful insights from data and apply it in a way that benefits your organisation.[1](#disclaimer)Increasing data literacy across an organisation, and in its leaders in particular, will help accelerate an organisation’s path to more effective business decisions.\n\n### **Getting the most from the data**\n\nProfessional services firm Deloitte says it’s important to have the right analytics tools and technologies in place when an organisation engages more with its data. “Invest in tools that fit now and that will be flexible and powerful enough to grow with the organisation,” it says in its report *Building you data analytics capabilities.[2](#disclaimer)*\n\nThe next step is to ask smart questions that will provide actionable insights.\n\nThose questions will be guided by the business’ strategy and could look like ‘What are our customers telling us? How do we measure up against our goals and against the competition? Where are costs exceeding return? Does that proposed new market or product meet our demographic and revenue criteria?\n\nCustomer-generated data can provide invaluable insights for any business, says Kate Morris, founder of Adore Beauty, a pioneer in retailing beauty products online in Australia.\n\nShe says digital businesses have access to many data points that provide valuable information about the customer.  “In most cases you’ll have more data than you could ever hope to use. There’s almost always data points that are easy to isolate. The key is to pick the pain points that are affecting the highest number of customers,” Morris says.\n\nData can identify why and how a customer uses an app and where on their journey they most commonly get stuck. Do they want different products, different delivery options or a smoother payment process? Using this data allows a company to position its products more appropriately, and helps retain and attract customers.\n\n**Growth opportunities**\n\nEuromonitor is an independent strategic market research group that has analysed the process of using data to make business decisions. In its report *8 Ways to Identify Market Opportunities for Business Growth[3](#disclaimer)* it discusses ways to take an even deeper dive into customer analytics and the market in which a business operates.\n\nIf a business is looking to invest or grow, it says customer segmentation can identify market opportunities. For instance, does the proposed location and market reach the target demographic?\n\nMarket and competitors’ data can help determine which brands and products are growing in a given industry and why. Businesses can then ask ‘How is our company placed? Do we have a competitive advantage? Is there an acquisition opportunity?’\n\nData can also be used to analyse complementary products or services that can boost revenue or increase product and service offerings. Euromonitor [cites](https://blog.euromonitor.com/8-ways-identify-market-opportunities-business-growth/) the example of a packaging company: by identifying and monitoring the sales of products it doesn’t currently package the company can determine if there’s an opportunity for it to package those products, particularly if their sales are rising.\n\n**What’s happening in your business?**\n\nHaving a comprehensive understanding of your company’s financial position makes decision-making more effective. This goes for the board of an ASX-listed company or a small family-run business.\n\nA tool such as CommBank’s Daily IQ can be used by businesses to give them timely insights about their business, based on transaction data.\n\nDaily IQ offers a suite of tools, each displaying a dashboard of easy-to-read data that allows businesses and organisations to see trends and changes over time, identify opportunities and validate actions the business takes.\n\nThe Cash Flow tool is the most frequently used by businesses. It helps business better understand their cash position and provides year-on-year comparisons, enabling them to optimise their cash flow.\n\nThe Busiest Times tool provides a heat map illustration showing the busiest times of the day based on sales, helping to inform things like rostering and stock.\n\nUsing data derived from card transactions Daily IQ also provides insights on customer demographics, location and spending patterns which can help businesses better target their marketing or identify potential new business locations.\n\n[Daily IQ](/business/online-banking/commbiz/daily-iq.html) is available for free to qualifying CommBank customers.

The reports and data dashboards help engagement with clients; they provide valuable industry and market insights that can enrich client conversations and can help in the shaping of value propositions. Moreover, using GlobalData products has helped increase my knowledge of the finance sector, the players within it, and the general threats and opportunities.\n\nI find the consumer surveys that are carried out to be extremely beneficial and not something I have seen anywhere else. They provided an insightful view of why and which consumers take (or don’t) particular financial products. This can help shape conversations with clients to ensure they make the right strategic decisions for their business.\n\nOne of the challenges I have found is that data in the payments space is often piecemeal. With GD all of the data I need is in one place, but it also comes with additional market reports that provide useful extra context and information. Having the ability to set-up alerts on relevant movements in the industry, be it competitors or customers, and have them emailed directly to me, ensures I get early sight of industry activity and don’t have to search for news.\n\n Senior Account Manager, TSYS \n\n“The GlobalData platform is our go-to tool for intelligence services. GlobalData provides an easy way to access comprehensive intelligence data around multiple sectors, which essentially makes it a one-for-all intelligence platform, for tendering and approaching customers.\n\nGlobalData is very customer orientated, with a high degree of personalised services, which benefits everyday use. The highly detailed project intelligence and forecast reports can be utilised across multiple departments and workflow scopes, from operational to strategic level, and often support strategic decisions. GlobalData Analytics and visualisation solutions has contributed positively when preparing management presentations and strategic papers.”\n\n Business Intelligence & Marketing Manager, SAL Heavy Lift \n\n“COVID-19 has caused significant interference to our business and the COVID-19 intelligence from GlobalData has helped us reach better decisions around strategy. These two highlights have helped enormously to understand the projections into the future concerning our business units, we also utilise the project database to source new projects for Liebherr-Werk to use as an additional source to pitch for new business.”\n\n Market Analyst & Management, Liebherr-Werk \n\nYour daily news has saved me a lot of time and keeps me up-to-date with what is happening in the market, I like that you almost always have a link to the source origin. We also use your market data in our Strategic Business Process to support our business decisions. By having everything in one place on the Intelligence Center it has saved me a lot of time versus looking on different sources, the alert function also helps with this.\n\n Head of Key Accounts, Saab AB \n\nHaving used several other market research companies, I find that GlobalData manages to provide that ‘difficult-to-get’ market data that others can’t, as well as very diverse and complete consumer surveys.\n\n Marketing Intelligence Manager, Portugal Foods \n\nOur experience with GlobalData has been very good, from the platform itself to the people. I find that the analysts and the account team have a high level of customer focus and responsiveness and therefore I can always rely on. The platform is more holistic than other providers. It is convenient and almost like a one stop shop. The pricing suite is highly competitive and value for our organisation.\n\nI like reports that inform new segments such as the analysis on generation Z, millennials, the impact of COVID 19 to our banking customers and their new channel habits. Secondly the specialist insight on affluent sector significantly increases our understanding about this group of customers. The combination of those give us depth and breadth of the evolving market.\n\nI’m in the business of answering and helping people make decisions so with the intelligence center I can do that, effectively and efficiently. I can share quickly key insights that answer and satisfy our country stakeholders by giving them many quality studies and primary research about competitive landscape beyond the outlook of our bank. It helps me be seen as an advisory partner and that makes a big difference. A big benefit of our subscription is that no one holds the whole data and because it allows so many people, so many different parts of our organisation have access, it enables all teams to have the same level of knowledge and decision support.\n\n Head of Customer Insight and Research, Standard Chartered \n\n“I know that I can always rely on Globaldata’s work when I’m searching for the right consumer and market insights. I use Globaldata insights to understand the changing market & consumer landscape and help create better taste & wellbeing solutions for our customers in food, beverage and healthcare industries.\n\nGlobaldata has the right data and the reports are of very high quality compared to your competitors. Globaldata not only has overall market sizes & consumer insights on food & beverages but also provides insights at the ingredient & flavour level. That is key for B2B companies like Givaudan. This way we understand our customers’ business and also gain insight to our unique industry”\n\n Head of Consumer Sensory Insights, Givaudan \n\nGlobalData provides a great range of information and reports on various sectors that is highly relevant, timely, easy to access and utilise.

The legislation that created and developed it - 1911–1959\n==============================================================================================================\n\nMain\n\nTopic summary\nA bank, to be called the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, was established with the passing of the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1911_. The Act was introduced to Parliament by the Labor Prime Minister and Treasurer, Andrew Fisher, and was passed on 22 December 1911, with the role of Treasurer having direct oversight of the Bank. It allowed for the new bank to conduct both savings bank business (through a Savings Bank Department) and general banking business, backed by a government guarantee.\n\nThe Bank opened for business in Melbourne, at the time the temporary seat of power of the Federal Government, on 15 July 1912 under its first Governor, Denison Samuel King Miller. Under the Act, management of the Bank was vested solely in the Governor. Section 21 of the Act allowed for the Governor of the Bank to establish the Head Office of the Bank in a location within the Commonwealth of his choosing. Miller, who was from New South Wales, chose Sydney, and the Bank would eventually open its new Head Office building on the corner of Pitt and Moore Streets in 1916.\n\nIn order to quickly establish a footing throughout Australia, under an agreement with the Postmaster-General’s Department, the Bank traded through existing post office agencies. By 1913, branches in all six states of Australia and London were in operation.\n\nIn 1920, the note issue function of Treasury was transferred to a Notes Board, with the Governor of the Bank an _ex officio_ member. The _Commonwealth Bank Act 1924_ transferred control of the note issue to the Bank through a board of eight directors, including _ex officio_ the Governor of the Bank and the Secretary to the Treasury.\n\nAs early as 1914, the Bank had supported the Federal Government through the raising of loans to fund Australia’s involvement in the First World War. From the 1920s through to 1945, the Bank increasingly took on more central banking responsibilities, in reaction to major events such as the Depression and the Second World War. These included determining advance policy, setting interest rates, and requiring private banks to lodge funds with the Bank. It also expanded its commercial banking business, with a separate savings bank created in 1927 from the Savings Bank Department.\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank Act 1945_ and the _Banking Act 1945_ together formalised the central banking powers of the Bank, allowing for administration of monetary and banking policy, and exchange control. The Bank’s Board was replaced with an Advisory Council comprised of Bank and Treasury officials, with the Governor responsible for managing the Bank. Legislation in 1951 established a new Board, which including the Governor, Deputy Governor, and the Secretary to the Treasury, with the Governor retaining responsibility for the management of the Bank.\n\nLegislation in 1953 and 1957 began the separation of the central banking operations of the Bank from its commercial ones, which had placed it in direct competition with other private banks, who felt this gave the Bank an unfair advantage, being both the regulator of banks and recipient of its own policies. Legislation in 1959 formally separated the Bank’s savings and trading bank activities from the Bank and created the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation comprised three statutory bodies – the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia; the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia; and the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia.\n\nThe _Reserve Bank Act 1959_ preserved the original corporate body, under the new name of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to continue the central banking functions of the Commonwealth Bank, while the _Commonwealth Banks Act 1959_ transferred the commercial banking activities into a newly created Commonwealth Banking Corporation, later renamed the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nFurther information\n_Origins of government banking in Australia_\n\nThe creation of a government bank in Australia has its origins in colonial Australia,1 where as early as 1819 a government regulation (‘_Regulations of the New South Wales Saving Bank: a depositary for the savings of the poor 1819_’) established the New South Wales Savings Bank, also referred to as Campbell’s Bank after one of its founders, Robert Campbell. With oversight by the Colonial Governor, the bank encouraged the poor and convicts, who often brought money with them to the Colony of New South Wales, to place their money in the bank for safe keeping. Later, convicts were compelled to deposit any money brought with them, with withdrawals only allowed for good behaviour. These compulsory deposits saw the bank grow rapidly, with the authority to manage these assets and extend the services offered going beyond its original remit.\n\nIn response to this, a savings bank, the Savings Bank of New South Wales, was established in 1832 by _Bill,2 William IV, No.13_, and by 1833 all the assets of Campbell’s Bank were subsumed by the new bank. The Colonial Governor was appointed the president of the bank, supported by a board of nine trustees; later increased to 18. A loan of £100 was made by the colonial government to enable the trustees to commence business. As well as encouraging good financial habits amongst its depositors, the bank paid interest on balances and offered loans to eligible customers.\n\nAs the Savings Bank of NSW was restricted by the legislation under which it was created, in 1870, another government bank, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was established by the _Government Savings Bank Bill 1870_ to offer additional savings and banking business facilities. The government bank, which was based on the post office savings banks in England, opened for business in 1871. Control of the bank was initially vested in a Treasury official, but this was later amended to a Board of Commissioners. In 1914, in part due to direct competition from the Savings Bank of NSW regarding savings bank business, the _Savings Bank Amalgamation Act 1914_ was passed, which transferred all the assets of the Savings Bank of NSW to the Government Savings Bank. Other colonial banks, including in Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia, were also established during these years, with the backing of their administrators, and with representation in regional areas.\n\nThe Government Savings Bank would itself be forced to compete with the Savings Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank, which opened for business in 1912, and offered a broader range of services and a large branch network. The Government Savings Bank was eventually absorbed by the Commonwealth Bank, through the passing of the _Government Savings Bank Bill 1931_. The State Savings Bank of Tasmania, the Queensland Government Savings Bank and the State Savings Bank of Western Australia were also subsumed by the Commonwealth Bank in 1913, 1920 and 1931 respectively.\n\n_Towards a national bank_\n\nThe depression of the 1890s saw many private banks collapse and people lose life savings. With confidence in the banking system severely affected by these events, and as the Australian colonies moved towards federation, many prominent citizens advocated for a national bank for the benefit of all Australians; a bank that would bring stability to the banking system and offer an alternative to the high fees charged by the private banks. A government bank that would allow the Federal Government to undertake business on the world stage, backed by a national banking system and on equal footing with overseas counterparts. While the form this national bank would take was not fully understood, many advocated for a bank along the lines of the Bank of England. In 1901, with the federation of the Australian states, the Australian Parliament could now make laws with respect to banking and currency on a nation level, and so the opportunity to establish a bank to undertake these, on behalf of the Government, was now possible.\n\nOne of the earliest and most vocal supporters of a national bank was parliamentarian King O'Malley. Elected to the Federal Parliament in 1901, first as an Independent and then as a member of the Labor Party, O’Malley advocated for a bank with reserve functions. In 1905, O’Malley unsuccessfully proposed a state-owned bank of deposit and issue to become part of the Labor Party’s campaign platform. In 1908, he presented a detailed plan to parliament for the creation of a government owned bank of deposit, issue, exchange, and reserve. In pursing these policies, he met with resistance from some of his Labor Party colleagues, who preferred a less ambitious approach, with Labor colleagues Billy Hughes and Andrew Fisher favouring a largely commercial bank, in direct competition with the existing private banks, rather than O’Malley’s more encompassing model.\n\nWhen Andrew Fisher became Prime Minister and Treasurer in 1910, he legislated to establish a national bank along the lines he had originally envisaged. The new bank would have no direct central banking responsibilities, be unable to issue money, or to finance government debt. It would also be prevented from providing subsidised credit for farmers and small businesses, as O’Malley had wanted. Instead, the new bank was to be operated on a predominantly commercial basis, and in competition with the privately owned banks already operating in Australia.\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914, two years after the Commonwealth Bank opened for business, the Bank was called upon to support and fund the Government's war efforts. Over time more central banking functions, along the lines first espoused by King O'Malley, would be legislated for through various amendments to the Act, with O'Malley later laying claim to being the 'father' of central banking in Australia.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank is established_\n\nWhen the six Australian colonies were united in a federation in 1901, the Constitution of the new Commonwealth of Australia empowered the Australian Parliament to make laws about currency, coinage and legal tender, banking, and the issue of paper money.\n\nThe _Australian Notes Act 1910_ passed control of banknotes to the Australian Treasury. A year later, in December 1911, the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1911_ came into effect. Passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives, and enacted by King George V, it created a Commonwealth Bank, with a Savings Bank Department for public deposits.\n\nThe Act of 1911 established the Commonwealth Bank as banker to the Commonwealth Government and its agencies, a function traditionally undertaken by the central bank of a country. Over time, additional central banking responsibilities were conferred on the Bank by the Government in response to economic events, with the first major challenge being the outbreak of the First World War. This forced the Bank to take quick action to fund the war effort and later the peacetime recovery.\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank Act 1924_ created a Board (previously the Governor of the Bank had sole management) and allowed members of the Board to appoint a chairman annually. While eligible for appointment, the Bank’s Governor was never elected Chairman of the Board during the years 1924 through to 1945. The _Commonwealth Bank Act 1945_ abolished the Board, replacing it with an advisory council of Treasury and Bank personnel. The 1951 Act re-established the Board, with the Bank’s Governor now made _ex officio_ Chairman.\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank (Savings Bank) Act 1927_ established a commonwealth savings bank with its own legal status but administered by the Bank. This separation foreshadowed the eventual separation of the commercial and central banking functions in 1959.\n\nChanges in society and the economy were reflected in amendments to the original Act. This included sole control of the note issue in 1924, and loan raising to finance the Second World War. From 1939, the Bank’s powers expanded under wartime regulations, including under the _National Security (War-time Banking Control) Act 1939-1945_. Under this legislation, the Bank was given the authority to regulate trading banks' lending and purchases of government securities. It also required the private banks to lodge surplus funds in a special account held by the Bank. Furthermore, the Bank exercised powers over foreign exchange transactions and bank interest rates. The aim of these regulations was to minimise the inflationary impact of war expenditure, to divert financial resources to war purposes, and to control the private banks' profits.\n\nOther legislation passed under the Prime Ministership of Ben Chifley, including the _Banking Act 1945,_ regulated banking and made provisions for the protection of the currency and of the public credit of the Commonwealth and gave the Bank further powers regarding government banking policy and commercial banking responsibilities. Previous attempts to pass a Banking Act, very soon after Federation and again in the late 1920s, had been unsuccessful.\n\nThe passing of the _Commonwealth Banks Act 1959_ and _Reserve Bank Act 1959_ separated the commercial and central banking functions of the Bank. A new bank, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation (today’s Commonwealth Bank), was created for the commercial banking operations of the original Commonwealth Bank, with the Reserve Bank as Australia’s central bank, and successor in law to the Commonwealth Bank established in 1911.\n\n**_Banking Legislation_**\n\nBetween 1911 and 1959, amendments to the original _Commonwealth Bank Act 1911_ saw the Bank develop more central banking roles and define and expand on its commercial banking functions. While there were many minor amendments made throughout these years, only the legislation containing the major changes, including the disbanding and later re-establishment of the Bank’s Board, interest rates, exchange control and control of the currency, are listed below. For all amendments to the Commonwealth Bank Act, refer to the [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/).\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1911_\n\nThe original Act of 1911 established the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Denison Miller was appointed the Bank’s first Governor and commenced duties on 1 June 1912, with the Bank opening for business on 15 July 1912. James Kell was the Bank’s first Deputy-Governor and was appointed to the role on 2 December 1912.\n\nThe Act of 1911 established a commonwealth bank, to be called the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as a body corporate with a common seal, and with the powers to carry on savings bank and general banking business, acquire and hold land, receive deposits of money, make advances by way of loans, issue bills and drafts, deal in exchanges including assayed gold, and borrow money. The savings bank business was managed by a Savings Bank Department within the Bank.\n\nThe Bank was to be given capital of £1,000,000 to establish it on a secure footing, but in the end the authorised capital was not required, with a short-term loan of £10,000 from the Commonwealth Treasury used to cover costs.\n\nAt the time the Bank was established, the Commonwealth Government was situated in Melbourne until a new federal capital could be established. The Bank opened temporary offices of the Bank and Savings Bank Department in Melbourne, with the Governor Denison Miller authorised to establish a Head Office of the Bank in a place within the Commonwealth of his choosing. To establish the Bank without interference, the Governor was given sole management of the Bank. His powers included being able to open branches and appoint agencies of the Bank in any part of the Commonwealth or Territory under the Commonwealth. He could also establish branches in London, and in any other places beyond the Commonwealth, with approval from the Treasurer.\n\nThe appointment of the Governor was for an initial seven-year term, with eligibility for re-appointment at the end of this period. The Governor was responsible for appointing officers to the Bank, as he saw fit. While a Deputy Governor was not immediately appointed, the Act allowed for this role, and under similar employment conditions, with a term of seven years and the eligibility for this to be extended.\n\nUnder the Act, the Governor was required to furnish statements regarding the assets and liabilities of the Bank and the affairs of the Bank to the federal government, with all to be subject to audit by the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Act stated that the Bank could not issue bank notes. The passing of the _Australian Notes Act 1910_ had transferred this function from the private banks and Queensland Government to Treasury. In 1920 this was transferred to a Notes Board with the Governor as an _ex officio_ member. It was not until 1924 that this function would pass solely to the Note Issue Department of the Bank.\n\nThe Government guarantee on the principal and interest due on accounts held at the Bank, with funds to come from internal revenue, was also legislated for, to deter any future runs on money, due to an economic downturn such as a depression. This would give depositors confidence in the Bank and in their deposits.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1914_\n\nWith approval from the Treasurer, this amendment to the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1911_ allowed the Bank to enter an arrangement with any other corporation carrying on the business of banking and for the Bank to purchase all or any of the assets of that corporation or part of the corporation.\n\nThe Bank could also, with the approval of the Treasurer, enter an arrangement with the proper authority controlling any Savings Bank constituted under the laws of a State to transfer any or part of the assets, liabilities, and business of that Savings Bank to the Savings Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1920_\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank Act 1920_ established a Note Issue Department of the Bank, to be kept distinct from all other departments of the Bank, with the Department managed by a Board of Directors composed of the Governor of the Bank as _ex officio_ Chairman, and an officer of the Commonwealth Treasury and two other directors appointed by the Governor-General.\n\nThe Act transferred all assets and liabilities as recorded by Treasury to the Note Issue Department. It also required that the Board hold in gold coin and bullion one-fourth the amount of Australian notes issued. The Department was also required to record the number of banknotes in circulation and returned, including those held by other banks. It also made it an offence for anyone to produce or be in possession of a forged note.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1924_\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank Act 1924_ amended the original Act to give the Bank sole control over the note issue, including the administration, printing, and issuing of Australia’s banknotes. The note issue had previously been managed by Treasury from 1910, and then a Notes Board from 1920.\n\nThe death of Denison Miller in 1923, who under the Act of 1911 had been granted sole management of the Bank, allowed the Nationalist Party of Prime Minister Stanley Bruce to make changes to the management of the Bank. Given the stature and admiration in which Miller was held, these changes would have been difficult to implement were Miller still in charge. With the support of the new Governor James Kell, who had been Miller’s deputy, Bruce placed checks and limits on the powers of the Governor.\n\nA Board of Directors comprising the Governor, Secretary to the Treasury, and six directors who had been or were actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance, or industry, was established, with directors initially appointed for varying terms, and then for seven years, with the option for re-appointment. Before appointment, each director was required to declare fidelity and secrecy. The Act declared a Chairman of the Board would be elected annually by the members of the Board, and the Board would meet at least once a month, and at any other times as required by the Chairman.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank (Savings Bank) Act 1927_\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank (Savings Bank) Act 1927_ established a commonwealth savings bank, to be called the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, and gave it separate legal status from the Commonwealth Bank, although it remained under the Bank’s administrative controls. A Chief Commissioner and two other Commissioners were appointed to manage the Savings Bank business.\n\nThe Savings Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank was established by the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1911_, and the bank opened for business on 15 July 1912 in Melbourne. Under the Act of 1927, all the assets of this Department were transferred to the new Commonwealth Savings Bank. The Act gave the new bank the authority to take over the business of other savings banks by arrangement, in whole or part, with the approval of the Treasurer. In 1931/1932, this section of the Act allowed the Bank to absorb the Government Savings Bank of NSW.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1929_\n\nIn response to economic instability and if in the interests of the Australian currency or Commonwealth, the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1929_, gave the Bank the authority, to requisition gold supplies from private banks.Through the operations of the Bank, the Treasurer could ask for particulars of gold coin and bullion held in public hands and to require the Bank to exchange any gold for Australian notes.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1945_\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank Act 1945_ rewrote the original legislation, incorporating a Bank charter for the first time. It was also the first legislation to declare that the Commonwealth Bank was Australia’s central bank. It also formalised the Bank's powers in relation to the administration of monetary and banking policy, and exchange control, and disbanded the Board, which was replaced by an Advisory Council of six, comprised entirely of officials from the Bank and the Treasury.\n\nThe legislation specified that the Governor was responsible for managing the Bank. When these amendments to the 1945 Bill were debated in Federal Parliament in 1945, Opposition Leader Robert Menzies opposed them and vowed that when in office, he would immediately reintroduce a Board of Directors to the Bank.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1951_\n\nUnder the Menzies Liberal Government, the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1951_, established a new 10-member Board, including the Governor, Deputy Governor, and the Secretary to the Treasury, with the Governor responsible for managing the Bank. Robert Menzies was elected Prime Minister in 1949 and reinstated the Board in his first term of government, as promised.\n\nUnlike in 1924, the 1951 Act appointed the Bank’s Governor, Dr HC Coombs, Chairman of the Board _ex officio_. In the Act of 1924, the Chairman had been elected annually by the Board members. From 1924 to 1945, the Governor of the Bank had never been elected Chairman of the Board.\n\n_The Commonwealth Bank Act 1953_\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank Act 1953_ established the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia and gave it the powers necessary to carry on general banking business. It was given a reserve fund to conduct business. With the approval of the Treasurer, the Trading Bank could take over the business of another trading bank, by arrangement. The remaining entity, the Commonwealth Bank effectively became the nation’s central bank.\n\n_The Commonwealth Banks Acts 1957 and 1959 and the Banking Act 1959_\n\nThe Commonwealth Banks Acts of 1957 and 1959 related to the future constitution and operations of the Commonwealth Bank.\n\nThe _Banking Act 1959_ allowed the government to repeal previous Acts and Bills relating to the Commonwealth Bank, allowing for these changes to legally take effect.\n\nThe Acts established the Commonwealth Banking Corporation as a public company, divided the assets of the banks and legislated for them to be registered as a company under the Companies Act. They also separated the commercial banking activities of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia into a newly created Commonwealth Banking Corporation. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation comprised three statutory bodies – the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia; the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia; and the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia.\n\nThe _Commonwealth Bank Act 1959_ established the Commonwealth Development Bank, which took over the assets and liabilities of the Mortgage Bank and Industrial Finance departments of the former Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nThe new commercial banking entity, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, wholly owned by the federal government, came into effect on 14 January 1960.\n\n_The Reserve Bank Act 1959_\n\nThe _Reserve Bank Act 1959_ preserved the original Commonwealth Bank of Australia, under the new name of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to continue the central banking functions of the Commonwealth Bank and to be the banker for the Commonwealth. Under section 7(1)(a) of the _Reserve Bank Act 1959_, the Reserve Bank inherited the body corporate established under the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1911-1943_, and that was continued under the _Commonwealth Bank Act 1945-1953_.\n\nThe Act created the Reserve Bank Board and Payments System Board, and the membership and appointment of members to both; also, the role of the Governor and Deputy-Governor. The _Reserve Bank Act 1959_ took effect from 14 January 1960.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1 The theory that the beginnings of a national bank could be traced to the colonial banking system in Australia was examined in Dr HC Coombs’ thesis, _The Development of the Commonwealth Bank as a Central Bank_, Master of Arts degree, University of Western Australia, 1931. Dr Coombs was the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank from 1949, overseeing the separation of the Bank’s commercial and central banking functions. He would become the first Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia in January 1960.\n\n_Useful resources relating to Commonwealth Bank legislation_\n\nThe Reserve Bank has online resources that may assist in providing context for the Acts that established and developed the Commonwealth Bank, including the colonial banks that influenced its creation. These include the following:\n\n*   ‘[Hidden History of Banking](https://museum.rba.gov.au/exhibitions/hidden-history-banking/)’\n*   ‘[Before Sunset: The Bank and World War I](https://museum.rba.gov.au/exhibitions/before-sunset/)’\n*   '[From Bank to Battlefield](https://museum.rba.gov.au/exhibitions/from-bank-to-battlefield/)’\n*   ‘[A Brief History | RBA](https://www.rba.gov.au/about-rba/history/)’\n*   ‘[Origins of the Reserve Bank of Australia | Explainer | Education | RBA](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/origins-of-the-reserve-bank-of-australia.html)’\n*   '[Collection Spotlight: King O’Malley](https://museum.rba.gov.au/exhibitions/collection-spotlight/king-o-malley.html)'\n*   T _he Commonwealth Bank Ac_ t/s 1911, 1920, 1924, 1927, 1929, 1945, 1951, 1953, 1957, 1959, and the _Reserve Bank Act 1959_, along with associated legislation including the _Australian Notes Act 1910_, the _National Security (War-time Banking Control) Act_ 1939-1945 and the _Banking Act 1945_ – all found on the following site: [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/).\n\nReferences\nThis information is drawn from records held by the Reserve Bank of Australia archives and the following sources:\n\nAustralian Government,_Federal Register of Australia_, 2024 in [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/), viewed March 2024.\n\nButlin NG (1970), ‘Some Perspectives of Australian Economic Development, 1890-1965,’ in C Forster (ed), _Australian Economic Development in the Twentieth Century_, George Allen & Unwin, Sydney.\n\nButlin SJ (1986), _The Australian Monetary System 1851 to 1914_, Ambassador Press, Sydney.\n\nCoombs HC (1931), _The Development of the Commonwealth Bank as a Central Bank_, thesis submitted for Master of Arts degree (awarded), University of Western Australia.\n\nCornish S (2010), _The Evolution of Central Banking in Australia_, Reserve Bank of Australia, Sydney.\n\nGollan R (1968), _The Commonwealth Bank of Australia; origins and early history_.

They include key legislative records held by the Bank, a coin and a horseshoe charm, both gifted to Denison Miller for the good luck and prosperity of the new Bank, photographs and other items that represent the establishment of the Bank in 1911.\n\nOf interest, and perhaps surprisingly, the Bank holds personal items relating to the federal parliamentarian, King O’Malley, for whom some credit towards the creation of a national bank may be given. Some of these items are listed below, and include a pocket watch and an epergne, both owned by O’Malley, which were given to the Bank in 1964 by the Office of the Public Trustee (the administrator of O'Malley's estate) in recognition of his role in supporting and promoting the need for an Australian central bank.\n\nA full listing of all records and collection items relating to banking legislation, Miller and O’Malley can be provided on request.\n\nNot all records and collection items held in the Bank’s archives have been digitised or photographed and uploaded on Unreserved. Access to these records can be provided, on receipt of a formal request, and at the discretion of the Bank’s archivists.\n\n*   MU-000163 Lucky Coin - 1907 Halfpenny coin found before the opening of the Commonwealth Bank and gifted to Denison Miller - 1912\n*   MU-000164 Horseshoe - 9ct lucky gold token - gifted to Governor Denison Miller by Mr William Walker - 17 June 1912\n*   MU-000269 Sculpture - Bronze - Bust of Sir Denison Miller executed by Nelson Illingworth - 1923\n*   2018/07329 The Commonwealth Bank - The Facts of its Creation, by King O'Malley (1908)\n*   2019/03175 King O'Malley: Man and Statesman, by Dorothy Catts - 1957 (book) (Dr H.C.

This edition focuses on understanding consumer attitudes, motivations and expectations of their experiences amid changes to the real and digital economy.\n\nThis edition is based on an online quantitative survey conducted by Fifth Quadrant on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank. The survey was conducted in May and June 2023 and was completed by 5,279 consumers of goods and services.\n\nEach respondent answered questions relating to one category where they had spent money in recent months, including:\n\nGroceries and liquor (n=406), clothing & footwear (n=406), homewares and household appliances (n=408), consumer electronics and entertainment including books, games, music and media (n=404), recreational sporting and outdoor goods (n=407), motor vehicle parts and accessories (n=406), health and beauty products (n=406), hardware, DIY, building and garden supplies (n=407), personal care services including hairdressing, beauty and weight loss treatments (n=406), fast food and quick service restaurants (n=405), pubs and clubs (n=408), restaurants and cafes (n=407), and accommodation including hotels, motels and AirBnb (n=403).\n\nThe sample was selected to ensure the results are nationally representative. All statistics and references to consumers in this report are based on the responses to the survey unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe report has been published for general information purposes only.

In 2019, they announced a $5 billion investment in technology to further its digital leadership and recorded a spend of $465 million on their marketing, advertising and loyalty operations.\n\nCombine all this with the fact that they operate in one of the most competitive and regulated industries — the Commonwealth Bank make for an excellent example of how to market online successfully and sustainably.\n\nIn this following article, you’ll get to peek behind the Paid Search and Social strategies of the Commonwealth Bank and see how they acquire customers and build their brand through these popular digital channels.\n\n**A Snapshot Of The Commonwealth Banks Website Traffic**\n========================================================\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank’s website ranks #22 in Australia by traffic, with over 25 million visits a month.\n\n![Image 4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:596/0*QlZDw7fhQIE_bI_D)\n\n![Image 5](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:590/0*HUU4V7MfXcfaoKlm)\n\nIn comparison, Westpac, another one of the ‘Big Four’ banks, ranks #33 in Australia with just shy of 15 million visitors a month.\n\n![Image 6](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:594/0*old4CS7QpCv-BXyo)\n\nThe majority of the Commonwealth Bank’s traffic (80%) comes from mobile devices.\n\n![Image 7](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:416/0*DPFruvObcP1HjKsp)\n\nAccording to SEMRush, search traffic makes up 21% of the Commonwealth Bank’s traffic while social makes up 1.3%. (Paid Social is sometimes not included in this, so the actual amount of traffic from Social, both organic and paid, could be much higher).\n\n![Image 8](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:484/0*QJfiZD2VvaHbl28-)\n\n**Paid Search Analysis**\n========================\n\nSearch makes up a significant proportion of the Commonwealth Bank’s website traffic. As such Paid Search is something which they invest heavily in.\n\nAccording to SEMRush, the Commonwealth spends an estimated $620K a month on Paid Search alone:\n\n![Image 9](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*aoumSwt6LHUpXvJa)\n\nAs you can see, this spend has ramped up significantly in 2019 after a subdued start to the year because of the Banking Royal Commission.\n\nSearches and advertising for home loans — one of the Commonwealth Bank’s most significant sources of business and search traffic — also traditionally picks up during Springtime.\n\n![Image 10](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*EmSoajESvRsSKRhV)\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank leads the ‘Big Four’ banks when it comes to their spend and volume of paid search traffic, confirming their reputation for being a leader in the digital space.\n\n![Image 11](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:691/0*QD1ERXwT3NgwnNtD)\n\nPaid keywords which bring in the most traffic, and which the bank spends the most money on, are for mortgages, car loans and personal loans.\n\n![Image 12](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:389/0*MevtSQnJ74I9kv39)\n\nInterestingly, the top three paid keywords are for calculators.\n\nOnline calculators tend to be a popular search and lead generation tool in the finance space. They are highly interactive (unlike articles) and gather valuable data which can be used to screen and pre-qualify prospects.\n\nHere’s one of the Commonwealth Bank’s Google Search ads and landing pages for their top search keyword, ‘mortgage repayment calculator’:\n\n![Image 13](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:501/0*kkM1VlOTz5Q143q6)\n\n![Image 14](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:350/0*lUefp0NI5oNlhpPA)\n\nOne great addition to this landing page is the property search, which leverages data from third-party provider, Domain.\n\nPeople can search and see what they could get with what they could borrow. And of course, there are smart placements for the Commonwealth Bank’s mortgage services.\n\n![Image 15](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:408/0*RNK807nwCnxi24Uj)\n\n**Other Observations About The Commonwealth Bank’s Paid Search Ads**\n\n**>Many ads link to a different URL and landing page to their organic search result partner.** This allows landing page variations for paid search ads to be tested and optimised. And also allows the design to be tailored for paid traffic (e.g. removing the menu in the header, removing links to content, etc.)\n\n**>Tracking parameters:** I found two URL parameters when clicking through on the Commonwealth Bank’s Google Search Ads.\n\nOne with 3 parameters: _?_**_pid_**_=133484&_**_sc\\_psk_**_=62908&_**_sc\\_crkey_**_=381762352493&m_\n\nThe other format I found included the above plus the usual UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign), internal campaign id, search keyword, match type and device (c=desktop, m=mobile as per Google’s ValueTrack nomenclature):\n\n_?_**_cid_**_=cr:hl:BAU\\_1909&_**_utm\\_source_**_=sem&_**_utm\\_medium_**_=goog&_**_utm\\_campaign_**_=BAU\\_1909&_**_keyword_**_=home%20loan%20repayment%20calculator&_**_matchtype_**_=e&_**_pid_**_=132966&_**_sc\\_psk_**_=353030&_**_sc\\_crkey_**_=382846488158&_**_c_**\n\nI’m not 100% clear why there’s an inconsistency but they probably have reasoning for doing so (if you are spending the amount they are on ads, religious tracking is important to allow you to know what and how to optimise).\n\n**Paid Social Analysis**\n========================\n\nIt’s unclear how much the Commonwealth spends on Paid Social channels like Facebook & Instagram — two of the most popular platforms.\n\nHowever, with Facebook being the second largest advertising network after Google, you can bet they are investing serious money on there.\n\nWhen we take a look at the Commonwealth Bank’s Ad Library on Facebook, which shows what ads they are running on Facebook and Instagram, we see there are a few different types of ads.\n\nFirst, there’s ads which advertise a specific offer:\n\n![Image 16](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:520/0*n94gRwRNHfF00C9c)\n\n![Image 17](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:520/0*neo3ZKNw9SdPtF-r)\n\n![Image 18](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:521/0*m54MZqu9-LKjn8c6)\n\nThere’s also ads for their charitable initiatives:\n\n![Image 19](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:521/0*u6R_7pDjyE1Hshrm)\n\nThey also run their TV ads on paid social:\n\n![Image 20](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:521/0*Ac8UeclUqXnu7Xzt)\n\nAnd they also promote content:\n\n![Image 21](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:521/0*lEeJQ8jMrSJH6W4l)\n\nOn the linked article, there is, of course, a call-to-action at the end to allow the performance of the content piece to be measured easily in terms of leads generated, not just engagement or clicks.\n\n![Image 22](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:598/0*tXZavyxaVX4Dc1h_)\n\nCuriously, ads for more news-driven content could not be found. If we look at the CBA Newsroom, we see lots of great articles which could be adapted into Paid Social Campaigns.\n\nFor example, this article on unclaimed benefits would make for an attention-grabbing advertisement for the Commbank app.\n\n![Image 23](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:530/0*z44n0XF58E9fmzyc)\n\nWhile this media release on home buying intentions could be adapted for an ad targeting home buyers and sellers (who want to know what the market is like currently), and offers to find out how much they could borrow, linked within the article.\n\n![Image 24](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:520/0*_qy4VU5BAyN0T5DS)\n\nThese Advertorial-style Paid Social ads would likely perform well for the Commonwealth Bank, and with such a cutting-edge digital team, I would not be surprised if they start (or already have) tested them.\n\n**Other Observations About The Commonwealth Bank’s Paid Social Ads**\n\n*   **All ads in their Facebook Ad Library (which covers both Facebook & Instagram) use video, with none using static images.** This could be because they have found the videos to offer lower CPMs and CPCs.\n*   **Only one ad variation for each campaign (with the exception of one campaign) could be found.** This was surprising as you’d expect multiple ad variations to be running. Though they may have already done rounds of testing and found the winners previously.\n*   **Fewer products and services promoted compared to Paid Search.** This could be due to the fact that their focus or capabilities are more developed in Paid Search. Or that they have a found a better return on investment on Paid Search than Paid Social. Or that they have found it better to focus on more select campaigns for Paid Social.\n\nSummary\n=======\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank is a leader in digital and digital marketing. They spend millions every year on Paid Search and Social, generate enormous amounts of traffic and revenue from it, and operate in one of the most competitive and regulated industries.\n\nAs such, they provide an excellent example of how to leverage these popular online advertising channels profitably and sustainably.\n\nEnjoyed this article?\n---------------------\n\nConnect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-cheung) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenatecheung) for more digital marketing case studies and insights.\n\n[Digital Marketing](https://medium.com/tag/digital-marketing?source=post_page-----56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n[Paid Search](https://medium.com/tag/paid-search?source=post_page-----56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n[Paid Social](https://medium.com/tag/paid-social?source=post_page-----56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n[Commonwealth Bank](https://medium.com/tag/commonwealth-bank?source=post_page-----56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n[Commbank](https://medium.com/tag/commbank?source=post_page-----56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Fp%2F56124ba54b59&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40nathanielcheung%2Finside-the-commonwealth-banks-620k-month-paid-search-social-growth-strategy-56124ba54b59&user=Nathaniel+Cheung&userId=277fbb059ca5&source=---footer_actions--56124ba54b59---------------------clap_footer------------------)\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Fp%2F56124ba54b59&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40nathanielcheung%2Finside-the-commonwealth-banks-620k-month-paid-search-social-growth-strategy-56124ba54b59&user=Nathaniel+Cheung&userId=277fbb059ca5&source=---footer_actions--56124ba54b59---------------------clap_footer------------------)\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F56124ba54b59&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40nathanielcheung%2Finside-the-commonwealth-banks-620k-month-paid-search-social-growth-strategy-56124ba54b59&source=---footer_actions--56124ba54b59---------------------bookmark_footer------------------)\n\n[![Image 25: Nathaniel Cheung](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*OckDrWcFiBMjZJhS8A9IHQ.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@nathanielcheung?source=post_page---post_author_info--56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n[![Image 26: Nathaniel Cheung](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*OckDrWcFiBMjZJhS8A9IHQ.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@nathanielcheung?source=post_page---post_author_info--56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\nFollow\n\n[Written by Nathaniel Cheung ---------------------------](https://medium.com/@nathanielcheung?source=post_page---post_author_info--56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n[7 followers](https://medium.com/@nathanielcheung/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\n·[1 following](https://medium.com/@nathanielcheung/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--56124ba54b59---------------------------------------)\n\nDigital marketing professional based in Sydney, Australia.

The Commonwealth Bank celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1962, Saturday morning trading ceased, employment of part-time staff began and improved career opportunities for women became available. Decimal currency, Christmas Club Accounts, personal loans and variations on traditional savings accounts were introduced.\n\n![Image 6: Decimal currency 1966](https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank-assets/about-us/2018-10/decimal-currency-1966_50split_l.jpg)\n\n Diversification \n\nDiversification\n---------------\n\n*   During the 1970s, our operations expanded into home insurance and travel (1974) and the following year, we formed our own finance company, Commonwealth Bank Finance Corporation Ltd (CBFC). During 1988, the Commonwealth Bank entered the managed investment and life insurance arena with the establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries Commonwealth Life Ltd and Commonwealth Management Services Ltd. \n\n Computerisation \n\nComputerisation & changing face of banking\n------------------------------------------\n\nMechanisation had gradually replaced traditional hand posting methods in use since the Commonwealth Bank’s foundation. In December 1969, we introduced the ‘Black Light’ Signature System, which recorded ‘invisible’ signatures in passbooks enabling withdrawals at branches other than the customer’s own without making prior arrangements.\n\nComputers started to change the way internal processes, telling facilities and routine operations were conducted. Our online computer network was complete on 15 July 1985 when the Norfolk Island branch joined in. Plastic credit and debit cards began to be used as the basis for transactions, starting with the launch of Bankcard in 1974, then Keycard in 1981. The Commonwealth Bank affiliated with Visa International and Interbank Card Association (Master Charge) in 1979.\n\nAutomatic telling machines (ATMs) began with the launch of Autobank in 1981. EFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale) commenced in 1984 and electronic home and office banking became available in 1985.\n\n![Image 7: Computer centre 1971](https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank-assets/about-us/2018-10/computer-centre-1971_50split_xl.jpg)\n\n Overseas activities \n\nOverseas activities & dealings\n------------------------------\n\n*   The island branch network was handed over to established local banking institutions – in Papua New Guinea (1974) and Solomon Islands (1981) – and important points of representation were opened in New York, Tokyo and Singapore. We widened our foreign exchange dealings and provision of services for customers engaged in business overseas and during February 1989, the Commonwealth Bank acquired a 75 per cent share in the New Zealand-based ASB Bank Ltd (expanded to 100 per cent in 2000). \n\n Deregulation \n\nDeregulation of the banking industry\n------------------------------------\n\n*   Deregulation of the banking industry and the subsequent entry of foreign banks into Australia in the mid-1980s posed significant challenges. These were met initially with restructuring of the Commonwealth Bank's internal organisation. New products and services were developed, targeted to meet the requirements of groups outside our traditional customer base. This process culminated in the organisation’s conversion from a government-owned entity into a public company. \n\n Mergers \n\nMerger with State Bank of Victoria\n----------------------------------\n\n*   On 26 August 1990, the Commonwealth Bank entered into an agreement with the Treasurer of Victoria for a merger with the State Bank of Victoria (SBV). The Commonwealth Bank became the successor in law to SBV on 1 January 1991, creating Australia's largest domestic bank and further strengthening the Commonwealth Bank's leadership in retail branch banking. \n\n[Back to top](javascript:void(0);)\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n*   [Security & scams](https://www.commbank.com.au/support/security.html?ei=CB-footer_security)\n*   [Help & support](https://www.commbank.com.au/support.html?ei=CB-footer_Help)\n*   [Financial assistance](https://www.commbank.com.au/support/financial-support/financial-hardship.html?ei=CB-footer_FinAssistance)\n*   [Complaints & compliments](https://www.commbank.com.au/support/compliments-and-complaints.html?ei=CB-footer_complaints)\n*   [Payment services availability](https://www.commbank.com.au/support/payments-services-availability.html?ei=CB-footer_PaymentServices)\n\n#### ABOUT US\n\n*   [About CommBank](https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us.html?ei=CB-footer_aboutus)\n*   [Careers at CommBank](https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/careers.html?ei=CB-footer_careers)\n*   [Sustainability](https://www.commbank.com.au/sustainability.html?ei=CB-footer_sustainability)\n*   [Newsroom](https://www.commbank.com.au/newsroom.html?ei=CB-footer_newsroom)\n*   [Investor centre](https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/investors.html?ei=CB-footer_investors)\n\n#### IMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\n*   [Accessibility](https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/accessibility.html?ei=CB-footer_accessibility)\n*   [Important documents](https://www.commbank.com.au/important-info.html?ei=CB-footer_ImportantDocs)\n*   [Banking Code of Practice](https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/opportunity-initiatives/policies-and-practices/banking-code-of-practice.html?ei=CB-footer_codeofpractice)\n*   [Cookies policy](https://www.commbank.com.au/important-info/cookies.html?ei=CB-footer_cookies)\n*   [Privacy statement](https://www.commbank.com.au/support/privacy.html?ei=CB-footer_privacy)\n\nCommBank acknowledges the[Traditional Owners](https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/opportunity-initiatives/opportunity-from-community/acknowledgement-of-country.html?ei=footer_aoc)of the lands across Australia as the continuing custodians of Country and Culture.We pay our respect to First Nations peoples and their Elders, past and present.\n\n©2025 Commonwealth Bank of Australia ABN 48 123 123 124 AFSL and Australian credit licence 234945\n\n[Commonwealth Bank](https://www.commbank.com.au/)![Image 9](https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank/images/global/cba-diamond.gif)\n"

Chetan mentored me during my early days at NetApp and provided valuable technical advice to solve testing challenges across a range of features. His automation skills and willingness to help had significant impact on many of my projects. I have also benefited from his excellent analytical skills and knowledge about the right tools for the task at hand when he lent his time and effort to help us with our data analysis efforts at Netskope. I would be glad to work with and learn from Chetan again."

For these reasons, Chetan was a pleasure to work with when we worked on SMB file server performance sizing models at NetApp.  His focus on modeling and analytics will be an asset in his future positions as Big Data moves from buzzword to an essential part of company strategy.  Though we worked at remote sites and never met in person, Chetan was both a friend and mentor.  I highly recommend Chetan."

If there's one person who can do a splendid job in helping organisations realise benefits from AI, that would be Prashant. I've worked with him very closely for the past few years and have seen him take products from ideation to development to convincing customers to use it and ensure they realise value from it. He has driven product strategy and execution in the space of Document processing, LLM powered applications, ML models with a strong focus on Governance. His best selling books, Keynotes in conferences and testimonies in Congress speak volumes about his knowledge, credibility and leadership. For organisations and people at the intersection of Healthcare and AI, I highly recommend Prashant as a trusted advisor and a person who gets things done."

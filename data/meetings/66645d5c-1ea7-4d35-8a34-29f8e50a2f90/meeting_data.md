"postText": "Just wrapped up my session alongside the incredible Marcus Rosen at the AWS Summit Sydney, delving into \"Implementing DevOps for Data science across global teams at Rio Tinto\"! üåèüíª His expertise with AWS technology truly shone through, making the experience electrifying for all attendees.\n\nAnd for a chuckle üòÇ ‚Äî apparently, our session was the only ML session that wasn't generated! No bots here, just good old human expertise and a passion for tech innovation! ü§ñ‚û°Ô∏èüß† \n\nAll jokes aside, the session provided invaluable insights into MLOps and global collaboration. \n\nHuge gratitude to AWS and the super star team for orchestrating such an inspiring event with amazing demos, and to everyone who participated! Let's continue pushing the boundaries of technology together! üí™üöÄ #AWSsummitSydney #MLOps #Riotinto #machinelearning",

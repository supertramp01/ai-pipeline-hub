"postText": "Just wrapped up my session alongside the incredible Marcus Rosen at the AWS Summit Sydney, delving into \"Implementing DevOps for Data science across global teams at Rio Tinto\"! üåèüíª His expertise with AWS technology truly shone through, making the experience electrifying for all attendees.\n\nAnd for a chuckle üòÇ ‚Äî apparently, our session was the only ML session that wasn't generated! No bots here, just good old human expertise and a passion for tech innovation! ü§ñ‚û°Ô∏èüß† \n\nAll jokes aside, the session provided invaluable insights into MLOps and global collaboration. \n\nHuge gratitude to AWS and the super star team for orchestrating such an inspiring event with amazing demos, and to everyone who participated! Let's continue pushing the boundaries of technology together! üí™üöÄ #AWSsummitSydney #MLOps #Riotinto #machinelearning",

"text": "I have had the opportunity to work with Chetan at NetApp and Netskope. Chetan mentored me during my early days at NetApp and provided valuable technical advice to solve testing challenges across a range of features. His automation skills and willingness to help had significant impact on many of my projects. I have also benefited from his excellent analytical skills and knowledge about the right tools for the task at hand when he lent his time and effort to help us with our data analysis efforts at Netskope. I would be glad to work with and learn from Chetan again."
"text": "Finding someone like Chetan with top-notch analytic and development skills in addition to being a great communicator is uncommon.  For these reasons, Chetan was a pleasure to work with when we worked on SMB file server performance sizing models at NetApp.  His focus on modeling and analytics will be an asset in his future positions as Big Data moves from buzzword to an essential part of company strategy.  Though we worked at remote sites and never met in person, Chetan was both a friend and mentor.  I highly recommend Chetan."

"postText": "Just wrapped up my session alongside the incredible Marcus Rosen at the AWS Summit Sydney, delving into \"Implementing DevOps for Data science across global teams at Rio Tinto\"! 🌏💻 His expertise with AWS technology truly shone through, making the experience electrifying for all attendees.\n\nAnd for a chuckle 😂 — apparently, our session was the only ML session that wasn't generated! No bots here, just good old human expertise and a passion for tech innovation! 🤖➡️🧠 \n\nAll jokes aside, the session provided invaluable insights into MLOps and global collaboration. \n\nHuge gratitude to AWS and the super star team for orchestrating such an inspiring event with amazing demos, and to everyone who participated! Let's continue pushing the boundaries of technology together! 💪🚀 #AWSsummitSydney #MLOps #Riotinto #machinelearning",

She has an uncommon passion for her work that results in a laser-like focus on outcomes and processes. \n\nAs a data scientist, Romina is perceptive to the client’s needs, the problem being solved, and the need for experimentation to drive the appropriate balance between higher accuracy and greater explainability.\n\nAs a manager, Romina is collaborative and a team player. She is a good teacher who strives to lift the team’s capabilities and a great learner who constantly improves her own skills. \n\nHaving worked with her on multiple engagements at Deloitte, I strongly recommend Romina and know she will be a great asset to any team or organisation that wants to put their data to work via advanced analytics & machine learning.
